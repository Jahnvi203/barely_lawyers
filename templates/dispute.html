                <b>If you are not enquiring on behalf of a company or business entity, (including private limited),</b> please note that the On-Site Legal Advice Scheme entitles you to a <b>one-off</b> free legal consultation on the subject-matter.
                Henceforth, you are strongly encouraged to formally notify your intent to dispute the claim via the Community Justice and Tribunals system if your matter falls under their purview. For more information, you may refer to the Judiciary website.
