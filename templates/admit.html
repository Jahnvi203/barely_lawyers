                <br>
                Admitting to a claim means you agree with it and do not dispute it. You may also request the following:
                <br><br>
                
                • Admit only part of the claim and dispute the rest;
                <br>
                • Admit the full claim but pay in instalments.
                
                <br><br>
                <b>If you are not enquiring on behalf of a company or business entity, (including private limited),</b> please note that the On-Site Legal Advice Scheme entitles you to a <u>one-off</u> free legal consultation on the subject-matter.
