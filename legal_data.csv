Family court said that she is not meant to have the maintenance (for herself) since she is now divorced, under Muslim law. Applicant has children that she is seeking maintenance for from the other spouse.","Lawyer is suggesting for the applicant to apply for maintenance for her children, since she might not be able to apply for maintenance for herself, under Shariah law. Lawyer is suggesting that the applicant should not concede to the other party's reluctance to pay for the further maintenance, applicant should seek to increase the maintenance by stating her case (including the change of circumstances) to the other spouse or the mediator (until applicant is satisfied), however if it is still unreasonable the applicant should go to court and argue her case and allow the court to decide how much should be given. Applicant should not ""agree"" immediately if she is not satisfied since it would be consent and irreversible.

"Applicant thinks that the child maintenance amount of $350 per month is too low. The maintenance order was by consent, and was given in 2005. The son is 20 years old now.

During the last mediation in 1999/2000, it was agreed that the maintenance amount will be $650.

The father has said that he will not pay for maintenance once the child turns 21.

Also, in her current marriage, there has been family violence for the past 12 years, the husband has a bipolar disorder, and she has a Personal Protection Order against him issued in 2010, before her daughter was born. She wants to file for a divorce. Further, her other child (a daughter) will be 12 years old next year. She has already approached Legal Aid Bureau.","Applicant can apply for a Variation Order. 

At present, the maintenance will only last till the child is 21 (which is in Jan 2023), unless the applicant can show that he is going for tertiary studies/further studies. The Applicant will have to show that there have been steps taken that show that the child is indeed going for higher education (eg. application to universities, acceptance to universities). She must also show the expected expenses to be incurred and till when.

What was discussed in the mediation is not binding, and cannot be brought up in court as it is said without prejudice. Only what is stated in the Court Order is.

As for the current divorce proceedings, since she has already approached Legal Aid Bureau, she should just wait for their response after she has gone for the Means Test. If she passes the Means Test, then it will take 6 to 8 weeks for Legal Aid Bureau to assign a lawyer to her case."
"The Applicant divorced her husband and the certification of final judgement is out. The court ordered the ex-husband to give the Applicant $300 per month for maintenance of the child (10 years-old). In addition to the $300 per month, the ex-husband is responsible for 70% and the Applicant 30% of the child's student care and tuition expenses. Without informing the Applicant, the ex-husband deducted the amount of money paid by about $100 per month. The ex-husband did not pay the full $300 maintenance. This has occurred from April till now.  

The Applicant is upset that the ex-husband did not inform her about the reasons why the amount was deducted. 

The Applicant is a long-term visit pass holder. ","The Applicant needs to find a lawyer and go to court as the husband has not paid the full amount of maintenance. 

If the Applicant is unable to foot the legal costs, she can try to find pro-bono lawyers (not from government schemes as the Applicant is not a PR or Singapore citizen). 

"
"Applicant has applied for a maintenance order and is due for mediation tomorrow. She is still married but has taken out the application for maintenance summons for her and her children. She notes that the husband has torn up the summons letter, and demonstrated uncooperative behaviour.","No recommended course of action. If parties both come for the mediation, then the mediators will try to resolve the issue without having to go to court. However, if her husband does not want to comply, then the matter will be transferred to the open court.

If the husband defaults, this should be raised to the courts immediately. She can also apply for legal aid for support with regards to the maintenance order issue. If she does decide to seek legal aid, she can request to postpone the mediation/court order.

If the husband is aggressive, she can also apply for a personal protection order.

She should request time to obtain as much evidence as possible pertaining to monthly expenses not being paid by the husband, etc."
"Applicant divorced her husband in 2017. He continued living with her even though they had already gotten a divorce. Applicant owns 84% of the house and husband does not contribute to maintenance of the house.

Applicant gave Husband has care and control of her 18 year old daughter in order to help him get a HDB flat. Last year he promised to transfer the flat under her name but he kept delaying signing the contract. Husband now wants to retain ownership of the flat. She has paid $16,000 for maintenance.",Chances of claiming maintenance is low as the judge did not order maintenance of wife during her divorce proceedings.  Applicant has to justify her reasoning for transferring the care and control of her children.
"Applicant wants to apply for the variation of maintenance order.

He applied to Legal Aid Bureau and was advised to come here

He is supposed to pay $750 for his 4 year old son, he wants to vary the maintenance to $400.

It was settled in the 1st enforcement case in 2020 for 8 months of non-payment the amount of 60k. Judge states that the applicant can come for the full sum if the ex-husband does not make a single payment.

2. Applicant also enquires about her wrongful dismissal. The notice was given on the day itself and it was not a proper retrenchment. Under her contract, the company should give the applicant 1 month's notice.","Lawyer advises that the Judge could order the ex-husband to owe her the 108k. However, it may not be useful to her as the HDB cannot be seized as it is protected. Applicant can go after CPF, bank account and items in the house. 

Lawyer advises the applicant to highlight to the court that the ex-husband had never paid any maintenance over the years, however, he had just bought a house. Applicant should definitely propose the ex-husband downgrade his house. Applicant can also propose that she have a share in the ex-husband's HDB.

"Applicant has a hearing for variation based on maintenance order in 2010. Family court matter since 2010. There was another maintenance order in 2017 and her ex-husband disappeared afterwards. Applicant got lawyer to get a WSS to sell the property. Suddenly, her ex-husband came back to slander applicant and the WSS was stopped. 

Applicant had been to jail 3 times over false orders. There is proof of him lying under oath and the judge told him that he has to settle with applicant. But he ignores everything that the judge is saying. Ex-husband defrauded her of shares in her company and owes her company.

Her ex-husband has been meeting with her children and making them sign declaration under oath to get her out of the house she has the rights to stay in.

"Applicant has a maintenance order in which he wants to make a maintenance order but after expiry of appeal.

His earnings have been reduced after unfortunate circumstances in which the court did not take into account.
His GM has been giving the applicant money to give his co workers but the court refused to take that into consideration
Applicant is unable to pay for the maintenance.

Applicant walked out of court before the verdict. ","Applicant should have already paid.

Applicant not paying means that he has breached the court order. Applicant has to pay certain fees to vary the order (filing fees)

The difficulty in apply for variation order is that the circumstances changed before the order but the court did not take it into consideration. There is no real time difference from the order being made till now as the circumstances haven't changed, just not being taken into consideration. 

There are no other viable alternatives for now as all alternatives cost money.

Applicant can try stop paying for utilities and pay for the maintenance and explain to the wife the gravity of the situation and pray for an agreement of variation. Otherwise, he can consider selling the house."
Applicant concluded his divorce proceeding and received his final Divorce Certificate. He owes a maintenance of $2000. He has recently lost his job which has resulted in a decrease in his income.

"Family - maintenance for son; biological father has been uncontactable. She is seeking a maintenance application against the father. 

Father has been completely uncontactable for the past 7 years. She would like the money for her son to pursue tertiary education. 

Son is currently 20 and turning 21 in 2 months. ","If the father cannot be located, there may not be any recourse available. 

Once the son turns 21, she will not be able to seek any maintenance for the son. Son will have to apply on his own, provided that he has a placing in a local university. 

One more consideration is why the applicant has not taken action for 7 years. If the husband has been informed that applicant has made an order and the applicant has knowledge of it, then an order may be enforced. 

If the applicant is to have any recourse, she needs to use her means to locate him. She may consider filing a police report for the missing father. "
"Applicant has a 6 year old child, wants custody of the child but the wife refuses. Applicant is not legally married to his wife. Currently, the wife is asking for sole custody but expects the applicant to pay for maintenance.

Applicant is a prime mover and earns $2000/month, he finds it extremely hard to provide maintenance.","Regarding maintenance:
-Applicant has to pay some sort of maintenance regardless
- Can appeal to the court in October to start maintenance payment in November instead of immediately
- Make a list of his expenses and see what figure is left that he deems appropriate for the maintenance payment.
- Can either do it himself or go through Legal Aid Bureau, but rejected because salary passes the threshold
- Find out what the wife is working as and how much she is earning now

Regarding custody:
- usually joint custody will be awarded, but can apply for the child to stay with the applicant.

"Applicant has a BTO that comes with a CGO (mandatory counselling order), the review is in 6 months. Applicant also has a PPO.  Applicant has no income and husband is not paying maintenance.","Court processes are lengthy, and the schedule cannot be planned. 

When applicant files for maintenance, must state the day that husband did not pay. Applicant's issue has started from July when husband did not pay, so court summons will begin from July.

Order for maintenance or divorce or PPO? Usually maintenance will come first. But there is no difference in the order nor legal advantage. Can even do all 3 at the same time.

Interim maintenance is just the maintenance before the court can hear out on whether the maintenance wishes to be changed. 

PJP is something that is outside of court, applicant cannot use PJP as she has already filed a family court case and previous negotiations do not work. 

Lawyer has advised the applicant client to get a lawyer. "

The matter has gone to court. The applicant's ex-wife had previously claimed for $30,000 3-4 years back, and there is still balance from that claim. 

The applicant has re-married and is facing financial difficulties in paying the maintenance. Applicant also has to pay his current wife's past medical bills.  Over the years, the applicant had not paid the amount to the ex-wife's account, but had contributed some to his children, however he does not have evidence regarding this. 

The applicant now does not have a good relationship with the ex-wife and the children. 
","The arrears maintenance payments would need to be paid and cannot be cancelled. The applicant can possibly discuss with the ex-wife regarding his situation, as she is the only one who can withdraw the claim. Applicant can possibly see applicant's MP. "

"The applicant underwent a divorce 1.5 years ago. The applicant's ex-wife is getting paid 2.5k. The applicant is a former employee of a company undergoing a fraud scheme. He is currently self-employed and earns around 3k. He is struggling to pay his maintenance fee of 5.5k. Which includes 3k of maintenance fee for his children and 2.5k to his wife. The applicant is paying for the helper, insurance for his children and the children's school fees. The applicant wants to reduce the total maintenance fee to 1.5k. ",The applicant should file for a variation of maintenance order at the Family court. It will not be difficult to reduce the 3k amount for his wife but will not be so for the child's maintenance. The applicant should show his current IRAS pay slip and the money stuck in his previous company.

"- Ex wife seeking maintenance reinforcement. Applicant has not been paying since the start of the year, supposed to be paying for 4 children $2000.

Eldest child turned 21 and automatically taken off, applicant left with 3 children to pay for. Second child quarreled with the applicant's ex wife and is now staying with the applicant now.

Divorce was finalised in 2016 by court order decided by a judge, lawyers engaged then.

Zoom hearing yesterday.","- Go through mediation process first. 

- 2016 and now, applicant is earning the same amount of money. Difficult to argue that there should be a change in maintenance fee unless can show material change circumstances. Likely need an installment plan to repay the $9000. 

- variation application should be done first 

- summon to change court order and affidavit (evidence) to be submitted, better to engage a lawyer."
"Applicant issued a court order last week for her husband to pay her maintenance fee for her and her 4 children, payment with effect from 3 October. They are not divorced yet. 

Recently, the husband has been saying that he wants to run away to India. The husband supposedly has savings in a bank in overseas.","Applicant will have to wait till 3 October. If there is no payment coming in for the maintenance, she can go back to court to obtain an enforcement order against him. But if the husband doesn't come back at all, then it seems that the Applicant doesn't have recourse. What the Applicant has now is an Interim Maintenance Order that is made during the marriage and not during divorce proceedings.

There is nothing that the Applicant can do to stop the husband from leaving the country/abscond. It will be more complicated to serve the enforcement order on the husband if he is in overseas. She would need to apply to Court for a different form of service (instead of personal service).

Applicant could consider taking out an enforcement order against the husband on 3 October, but it would be difficult if the husband has not left the country. She would need to explain why the husband is likely to abscond. 
 
Applicant would also need to check if the court orders can be enforceable in overseas, which is doubtful."
"Applicant's ex-wife (divorced 10 over years ago) had been ""missing"" for around 15 years, bringing the daughter along. She had not asked for the payment of maintenance at that time. Now, she has come back and is asking for maintenance. Applicant has agreed to give her some money after going through mediation.

During the mediation, it was decided than the sum would be about $30,000, every month paying $150. He has been doing so, but now, she is asking him for the $500 maintenance that was agreed during divorce proceedings for the daughter, which he cannot afford (income $2000 a month). They have gone to court for this, and that judge ordered the $150 maintenance. The daughter is 17 now, still a student.

Applicant has an enforcement order against him stating that he agreed to pay her a lump sum in instalments. The arrears that he agreed to for the mediation is for the $500 maintenance for the daughter at the time of the divorce. This amounts to $150 a month.","Applicant should consider hiring a lawyer, or it will be very difficult for him to fight against this. But he can still do it on his own.

The ex-wife may take out an application for an enforcement order $500 maintenance, so the Applicant should be prepared for that.

It seems hard to vary the consent order for a lower amount. He would have to take out a Variation Order with reasons in the application. If he does not have a lawyer, he does not need to file an affidavit. Applicant should check whether the daughter is still studying. If the daughter is still going to study till 21, then he would still have to pay the maintenance. If the daughter is 18 and above or working, it will be easier for the Variation Order to be given.

Applicant can ask to have access to the child. Applicant should also put reasons and ask the judge to make an order to give Applicant reasonable access to the child (with the days and time).

Regarding the compensation for not seeing his child for over 10 years, that should have been discussed at the mediation when the amount in arrears was discussed.

As to whether Applicant can go back to get the court to rescind the consent enforcement order, it is unlikely. But Applicant would have to give reasons as to why he had consented, and why he wants it rescinded."

Applicant can also consider whether she wants to proceed with the custody issues now or when the child's father completes his sentence. Applicant can also apply to change the maintenance fee amounts in the future. The Court will also consider whether Applicant will be able to support the child, and this is usually done through proof of employment."

The son will return to Singapore to start his education in K1. The Applicant does not want any maintenance from her spouse because she does not want him to have any contact with her son.

This is to be fair to the Applicant's son, to allow a way to make sure the son is well taken care of in future. Just because the Applicant's spouse has not paid in the past, does not mean he does not need to pay in future.

-Whether or not the Applicant's ex-spouse provides maintenance or not is a separate issue 

-As far as the son's expenses are concerned, the court will consider the salaries of both parents' salaries when calculating maintenance.

-Now that the marriage is over, it is best to focus on ancillary matters. As there don't seem to be many contentious issues in the divorce, it should be fine to proceed on the maintenance application concurrently with the divorce proceedings. "

"Applicant is in the process of getting divorced from his wife. Applicant alleges that he had always been living financially separate from his wife. However, recently, the ex-wife complained that she does not have enough money. As a result, the ex-wife applied to the FJC for a maintenance order, which was later granted.

The terms of the maintenance order was: 
Applicant makes a $2100 one time payment, with additional payments for the child's expenses to be paid by the wife.

Applicant has complied with his part of the maintenance order by transferring $2100, but he alleges that his wife had refused to perform her part of the obligations, as she had refused to pay for their children's expenses.","The Applicant has to go back to the FJC to vary the maintenance order on the basis that his wife has not been complying with the order.

The ex-husband only wishes to pay a maximum of S$100 per month, much lower than the $800 that the Applicant originally wishes or the S$450 suggested by the mediator. Ex-husband subsequently expressed his wishes to apply for a variation order to the court, premised on the fact that he is no longer drawing an income.

Mediator also reminded the ex-husband that the 6 months arrears of maintenance still needs to be paid, which the ex-husband paid promptly. Applicant argues that that indicates that he still has money to pay her. 

Applicant alleges that her ex-husband threatened her children that if he still has to pay maintenance, he will sue their children for parents' maintenance so that he can pay her.

"$1,200 a month for 3 children maintenance - she does not agree with it 
7, 8, 12 year old kids
she lives in shelter with kids
His monthly contribution was $1k, salary should be about $5-6k
Previously his job was around $15k.
Judge seemed to rule in favour of husband.
LIB lawyers not very helpful in the court process.
Matrimonial flat - she contributed 50% or more but husband does not admit that.
She can apply for a variation on the maintenance - the question will be how much will they vary to.
The total she would require for the children in a month for maintenance would be approx $3800 or more, not even inclusive of housing. 
Problem is that the court said that she has to seek shelter for herself so at most she can only claim partially from her husband.
She has 5 pax to house - 3 children, one helper and herself.
She feels rent will be approx $3250 MINIMUM, but up tp $5000.
$3800+2500(half of rental) will be what she is likely to be able to claim. 
She is currently unemployed, will be starting a job next month.
Court will ask about her employment and his employment and his salary etc, in deciding whether or not they will vary the sum.

","Apply in court  for a variation of the maintenance fee to be increased.

Get evidence of her husband's income - CPF and income tax. 

Use Jakarta property ($80,000) to offset maintenance - aka ask husband to give her his share of the property (they have joint ownership) so effectively she gets $40,000 which she can claim instead of getting monthly maintenance for the next few years. 

She needs to adduce proof that he has money / is rich in order to make her case stronger, seeing as the husband is ""hiding his income"" via producing proof that his salary is very low. 

She can seek help at maintenance support central - two things she can do 
1. They can help her get maintenance
2. Credit reading agency - she can lodge complaint that he hasnt been paying maintenance -- his credit will be low and may not be able to get credit cards and also he will have problems with  the mortgage. 

She can apply to the court to get the PPO against her cancelled - and instead get a PPO against her husband. 

Find out whether her husband currently has any other properties under his name that will be a reason to increase maintenance, or even better, whether he actually had property before the divorce judgement which would proof he was lying.

If she is right about husband trying to revoke citzenship in singapore and move back to jarkata. What she can do is find proof that he is revoking citizenship and trying to take CPF back to jarkata with him. The courts can lock his CPF and then use this money to pay her since he is not singaporean anymore and should not be entitled to his CPF contribution. "

"Ex-husband varied divorce agreement to my disadvantage. So i wanted to make a variation myself too. For the variation application, I met the judge once only. 

On Jun 1, court sent us final order amending the sum inside. Zoom meeting on 22 May, maybe because Judge is malay, he could not understand what was being said. Interpretor was present but could not translate. For the second court order, I did manage to vary it. However, with regards to the finding, I think the judge might have misunderstood me. For CPF refund, it should be from 50% of husband share. The latest order is that both parties agree to valuation of property. If they cannot agree, the HDB accredited valuer will value. The sale proceeds will be:
(1) The return of CPF money to Pfs
(2) After refund of CPF, anything left will be divided 50% to each.

Asking for variation for an amount which equivalent to the proceeds. At the time of divorce, did she make any payment by way of CPF? I did not use CPF. I used cash.

We divorced in Taiwan. It was stated in divorce agreement for 50% to come to me. Even without HDB, I should be entitled to 50%. He lied to court saying he needs financial relief.

The court gave the order and meeting on Jan 9, but her ticket back to Taiwan was on 15 Jan. She feels that it is unfair.","If you want to claim that 50% split should be performed prior to the CPF refund, then it should be appealed against back in 2020. 

If your position is that 50% should come from the net proceeds of the sale of property.  You can appeal out of time, but need to prove that this 14 day limit sufficiently prejudices your rights.

Variation is not an appeal. A variation will not succeed. You need to file an appeal, but the chances are slim.

The Ex-husband will likely enforce the court order, even if the proceeds are sold by HDB in accordance with the court order."

"Enquire about spouse maintenance. Last 7 years, spouse left her and her 3 children. Only recently she asked for a divorce. Was told not to use the word abandon. After he left, it was a shock. They quarrelled over infidelity. She would text him telling him they need to eat and need bills, he would ignore. 3rd year, she googled and she saw that the spouse can pay even if there is separation and not divorce. She was told that she is not qualified for legal aid, because of the matrimonial home and a car that is under her name but was taken away. Stopped going the legal way. Recently hired a private lawyer asking for a divorce. Does not mind the divorce but he does not want to give up the house. Landed property. Joint name. No mortgage, fully paid. He said in Hokkien, if you sell the house, he would do something back. Wife asked to reconcile but he refused. He has a mistress. Husband met with an accident overseas. Road accident. Told children he was hospitalised. Happened in 2016. Was hoping he would come home. Now 69 years old. When he left 7 years ago, son was 18, now just graduated and found a job. The oldest one is working. Second one was also working, just graduated, so contract did not have much money. She told husband that he has to support the children, but he did not care. Relationship with the kids is still okay. The son was struggling with JC exam then army. Oldest girl is quite independent, very close to the dad. All shocked that the dad left and did not bother to reconcile or explain. This whole time she has been using her funds. Until 2 years ago, she lived by credit card. Around 20,000, asked her oldest daughter for help. 2014 before he left, maid of 24 years went back, husband said he would help to get a new maid. Free travel yearly because SIA crew, worked until 2014, so he has a lifetime ticket for spouse. Before flight, he usually buy a lot of food to make sure the children have food to eat. Was a good father until he met the new mistress. But did not care about the wife. During his absence, water pipe burst, termite. Wife contributed CPF. Husband refuses to cooperate to get the divorce done. He will claim that he has dementia, has hospital proof. The accident in 2016 was serious, children heard from the doctor that the father refused operation. Mistress knows everything about the accident. Husband still comes back to see the eldest daughter, tells the other 2 children to ""shut up"" when the children tell him that these are ""ungodly things"". Past 3 weeks, ask for maintenance by court. The divorce is ongoing. Husband always act blur and refuses to hire a lawyer. Wife told lawyer she has no money and income and cannot carry on like that. Today was the second meeting with the lawyer on zoom, people can hear, husband said what he is asking for is ridiculous. Wife not working, worked until 2012. House is in a very bad shape, crack, termite, issues with ceiling but don't know where it came from. Wife gave up and got a company to find out what is wrong with the house. Wife told husband to come back and see the house. Water pipe burst 3 times, he did not pay for anything. Family became very distant. Husband has a lot of cash. Did not file affidavids. Now mediation only, have not seen the judge. Husband claims he has dementia, until lawyer wrote him a letter to attend court for the divorce, then he said he has mental capacity problems and cannot go to court. Mistress has all the reports about the mental capacity. Encourage the husband to visit the daughter. Need lawyer because he has dementia, was told he need a lawyer. Husband refuses to get a lawyer. Husband knows that wife has no income and is deliberately delaying. Wife has photocopies of bank balances. Not enough money. Poor daughter keep having to pay. Applied 3 years ago but got struck off. This is because Husband did not attend. Wife also saw the date wrongly, and did not attend, was told the case was struck off. Mistress wrote in to stop the divorce. Husband was a bit scared, asked mediator to settle it privately. Wife asked for $4,000 a month but husband said he has no income. Wife knows he is cash rich. Lawyer is doing divorce, nothing is materialized. Wife wants maintenance now. ","Cannot claim. 7 years is too late. No judge will agree to backdate. Maximum is 6 months. 
Husband is already a retiree. 
1) Is husband liable to pay? 
2) How much to pay? 
Need to file affidavid before adjudication. Need to say what are her expenses per month, cannot included children expenses because they are adults. Only can include house and her own maintenance. 
Need to prove he is cash rich and the judge is convinced then okay. Disclose material facts. 
Need to hire a surveyor for the current state of the house. 
Burden of proof is on the wife. 
Unfortunate situation because the husband has medical certificates. 
Proceed with interim maintenance first. 
Mental incapacity, husband need to get a deputy. "
"Applicant (""A"") divorced for many years. Child is 21 years and is now in NS. Just entered to army, unsure if education 
A has a seperate family and 2 other children","The child would usually have to apply himself for maintenance directly against you. But right now army income does not count as salary The ex-wife will not be able to make an application on the son's behalf.
Should explain the circumstances to the 
A has an obligation to maintain even after 21 and likely during the course of education. This is the law.
Should discuss with son and in writing to negotiate with him in order to adjust the maintenance or not pay at all. But this will be between the son and A. Since A has paid up everything in terms of maintenance with wife, there is no issue for wife to file an application. 
Under the law there is a obligation to maintain the child up till the first degree.
A has to find on the marriage registry whether his wife has remarried - if she is then A dont have to pay alimony anymore.
Have the agreement between your son to be in writing. Son needs to prove how much he needs. A needs to show his income and how much he can pay to support. But if there is an agreement it will be fine. A can stop and explain to the son and negotiate it.
"
"Applicant's ex-wife took out an enforcement of maintenance order against him. Currently his salary will not be able to cover the maintenance fees.

Due to financial circumstances since the pandemic, he had been giving her a reduced amount of maintenance. She initially had not made a fuss about it for 1-2 years, but is now seeking arrears.","To resist the enforcement order, write out the facts and attach evidence, such as the exchanges between him and ex-wife where his ex-wife accepted the reduced amount of maintenance previously. 

For application to vary maintenance order, he will need supporting documents such as evidence that his income has been affected since the pandemic. File under Crimson Logic. Family Justice Court website has resources that he can refer to. 

Since he does not qualify for legal aid, he will have to look for a private lawyer. He can try to negotiate for a cap fee."

Parties have one child who is living with the father. The learned and honorable Judge awarded 6 months maintenance because he was of the opinion that the applicant could get a job. Husband allegedly receives $9,500 per month in income. He is able to pay more according to the applicant and the applicant asked for and wants $1,500 per month. The applicant has been unable to find a job and is struggling with manual work because she grew up in a very good family. She also speaks poor English and this is difficult for her to get a job due to her language issues. The applicant is down to her last $40 until the next maintenance payment in 2 weeks' time.","1. The lawyer recommends that the applicant appeal the decision. 2. The applicant should go to the legal aid bureau to assist with the appeal. She may be eligible for legal aid due to her low income and savings. 3. The applicant appears to have passed the 14-day deadline to appeal, however she may be able to get leave of court to appeal after the deadline."
Applicant wishes to apply for variation of maintenance order. He wants to increase the maintenance amount. He is unable to lodge the application as the system did not recognise his court order number.,"Applicant has to be precise with what he is asking from the court, and specify why he wants to vary the maintenance order. Applicant should go to Crimson Logic to seek help for accessing the forms."
"-The applicant has to pay maintenance of $700 to his ex-wife every month. He has defaulted on the payments for a few months now and he was in a road accident last month, leaving him with many broken bones. He is currently on MC and long-term compulsory no paid leave till Feb 2022 with the possibility of an extension as the injuries had apparently affected his liver. 

The applicant and his ex-wife are not on good terms. The next maintenance due date is on 21st Dec, and the applicant will not be able unable to pay $700 by then either.","It is recommended that the applicant wait for the court hearing which will be held after the ex-wife lodges another complaint.

Alternatively, he can go to Family Court to make an application to vary the maintenance. but this is not advisable as the applicant is in a lot of pain."
"Family court asked applicant to seek legal advice. Applicant has 2 kids. Firstly, older child (son with special needs) has turned 21 in October this year. The applicant's ex-husband has cut his share of maintenance although the court order does not state that maintenance should be cut after the child turns 21. The child has special needs after graduating from ITE, run into several problems with traffic police, has borderline IQ and has been sent to IMH for further assessment. The applicant thinks that her 21 year old son needs continual support until he gets a job and wants to continue or increase maintenance, and send the son back to his father (her ex-husband) because the latter is living well. Applicant has asked for PPO as the special needs child has been violent towards applicant and her daughter. Son rents a car and does delivery. Applicant says he has road rage. Applicant says he can't feed himself. There will be another full assessment from IMH to get a full psychologist report. The speicla needs child is staying with applicant and daughter. Care and custody of the special needs child is with the applicant. Secondly, The applicant's younger daughter has agreed to study in Australia. As the term starts in January, applicant wants more maintenance to support daughter's education.","Have to apply to court to vary the maintenance order for increasing maintenance for daughter, such as duration of studies, school fees, etc. This is subject to the ex-husband's income and whether he can afford it. However, if the son is working, there is likely no case for increasing maintenance order. Nevertheless, applicant needs documentation to show son is special needs, and needs to increase maintenance and move back to the father. All these documents should be expert reports from the hospital. If the daughter's case is urgent, she should apply for the daughter first then, and let the court know that the other reports are still pending but will submit once it is available. Can enclose the daughter's letter about the son's violence and father's indifference and living very well but refused to support her, attached to the affidavit. The applicant must show proof that the applicant has insufficient income. It is possible to ask for urgent application for daughter studying in University of Melbourne. As long as the son is receiving education, the law will provide for some maintenance."
"The applicant believes the maintenance fees are very unfavourable to the applicant as he has to pay the fees for both children until they are 21 or have completed their university studies. His eldest daughter is 24 however she has not yet completed her university studies as she is only studying part-time, and he has to continue paying her $500 per month. She also refuses to see the applicant although he has access. The applicant just went for mediation regarding the maintenance with Family Justice Court on this day. The eldest daughter went to court as the applicant refused to pay the maintenance fees after she had closed the joint saving account holding $1500. The applicant asserted that the $1500 in the account offsets the maintenance fees, however his daughter denies it. His younger daughter is 21 and she is pursuing further studies in an Australian university.","The applicant should file a writ of summons for variation of maintenance fees. The applicant should go to the registry at the Family Courts to find out the exact procedure. He should prepare an affidavit stating his reasons for changing the order: his daughter is already gainfully employed, she is already 24 and she refuses to see him although he has access. For his second daughter he should state that he will continue paying until she finds work. He should then bring these documents to Crimson Logic Service Bureau to file them.

"The Applicant has a pending family maintenance court order against her ex-husband. She divorced her ex-husband in 2001, and had a maintenance order for both the Applicant and their child. However, the Applicant’s ex-husband did not attend court as he was under warrant of arrest, was jumping bail and it was hard to enforce the order and make sure he paid. The ex-husband has not been making payments since 2013. The Applicant was notified by the police that her ex-husband passed on on 14 November 2021. The Applicant claims that the maintenance owed to her by her ex-husband is over $100k. She wants to check if the ex-husband’s CPF nominee can be changed to her daughter, who is 21 this year.
","The Applicant can sue her ex-husband’s estate and administrator. The Applicant is advised that enforcement of maintenance orders can normally only backtrack for up to 3 years. The Applicant is recommended to engage a lawyer for this. Further, the Applicant can get her daughter to apply to be a public trustee. She should visit the Public Trustee Office who will further advise her."
The Applicant’s child recently turned 21. The Applicant’s ex-husband has ceased paying maintenance. The child has never interacted with his father since he was 4. The Applicant’s maintenance order does not state anything about when her ex-husband can stop paying maintenance.,"The Applicant is recommended to engage a lawyer to deal with the legal issues. As the Applicant’s son is 21, he may need to express his own desire to enforce the maintenance. The Applicant may be able to build a case from the Women’s Charter Section 68, which states that the duty of parents is to maintain their children until the point that their child is financially independent. The Applicant should explain how the stopped maintenance payments will affect her child’s ability to continue his university education. If the Applicant is unable to receive help from the HELP family clinic, she is recommended to check out the Singapore Council for Women organisations. The Applicant can also see if she is eligible for aid from the Legal Aid Bureau."
"The Applicant has ordered to be served a submission concerning the ex-husband's amendment in the maintenance. The present maintenance is $800 since 2006. Applicant's ex-husband wants to either cancel the maintenance or pay a reduced amount (undisclosed). Applicant's ex-husband is working and according to his bank balance, there is $5,000 – $11,000 entering the bank account. Ex-husband has also not paid Applicant is not working at the moment. Ex-husband denied some facts in the applicant's affidavit, such as the applicant forking out money to save ex-husband's business, etc.","A submission is a summary of what was stated in the affidavits (including ex-husband's). In the Applicant's submission, Applicant must write a background about the history of facts and summarise what was on her affidavit. In the present submission, Applicant may also include what she wants to tell the judge (e.g., in para 5, he said... but this is not truth). Applicant must also thoroughly read the ex-husband's affidavit and contest its reasonableness, truth and validity. Applicant must also include the outcome she wishes to seek. The present submission must only include matters concerning the maintenance. History of facts that are irrelevant should not be included. What was not present in the affidavits cannot be included in the submission."
"Applicant divorced her husband in 2003. The order said that her house must be transferred to her and she must pay 50%. Lawyer has told her that she must pay within 2 months or she must pass the key for the house to be sold off. Her ex-husband pays her maintenance on and off. She is taking care of her son by herself. The order says $700 to son and $500 to wife and the husband has not paid over $100,000. She did not bring the order of court.",Lawyer advised her to return another day with the court order because the applicant was unable to explain the terms of the divorce.
"Applicant (Chinese speaking) divorced his wife in April 2020 and pays $1000 monthly for child support. However, in February 2021 the Applicant stopped making payments for child support because he was not making enough to do so. His current job pays him $1400 a month, of which he receives $1278 after CPF contributions are taken out. As the Applicant is renting a place for $600 a month, he spends roughly $1000 on living expenses monthly. The Applicant claims he explained his situation to the judge in February 2021, but the judge ordered him to continue paying monthly child support of $1050 starting from 6 December 2021. The Applicant also claims that the Legal Aid Bureau did not accept his case.","Since the Legal Aid Bureau did not find the Applicant eligible for support, the Applicant is advised to represent himself as he cannot afford a private lawyer. The Applicant is advised to go to the family court (Level 3) and explain his situation to try and reduce the monthly child support amounts."
"The Applicant’s husband has failed to pay her maintenance fees for the past two and a half years. Since 27 August 2018, he has only paid her 5 times, despite having been through two mediation sessions. He owes her an arrears of $23,000, and is seeking to have the arrears waived, and to lower the maintenance payments to $0, as he claims that she gambles the maintenance payments away. The Applicant claims to be an occasional gambler. The Applicant has a court hearing regarding the lowering of maintenance payments on 16 November 2021. However, she was unaware of this as the summons was sent to her old address. Her ex-husband was aware that she had moved, but unaware of her new address. As a result, she received the summons late, and does not have sufficient time to finish constructing her response to the affidavit. Her ex-husband claims that the hearing on maintenance payments should be held on 16 November as the hearing for the maintenance fees must be heard before the hearing for the arrears. This is in spite of the fact that the maintenance fees and the arrears are two distinct issues. Applicant wishes to find out if she can request for adjournment of the hearing on the maintenance payments to after the hearing for her arrears, which would be heard on 1 December 2021. She also wishes for advice on what to address during the court hearing on 16 November 2021.","The Applicant is recommended to address the allegations against her and request for adjournment on the hearing on 16 November 2021. Prior to the hearing, she is recommended to identify the points in the affidavit that she disagrees with, and gather evidence if possible to prove any untrue points in the affidavit. During the hearing on 16 November 2021, the Applicant can also explain to the judge that the matter of the arrears which would be heard on 1 December 2021 is distinct from the matter of maintenance fees, and that the order of the hearings is irrelevant. It is likely that the judge will allow the court to be adjourned, given that the Applicant is unrepresented, and that she received the summons late. The Applicant is also recommended to engage a lawyer to respond to the affidavit. As she is unemployed, she can request for her ex-husband to pay contributory legal fees during the hearing on 16 November 2021."
"The Applicant is seeking advice on how to reduce his child maintenance sum. Currently, he is paying $750 of child maintenance per month. He always makes the payment on time. However, he is going to lose his income soon as he had tender a resignation letter. This resignation was due to his company's request of asking their employees to resign themselves instead of retrenching the employees so that the employees will have a better job prospect in the future. The reason the company gave was that the company wishes to revise the team and is undergoing some restructuring in the company. In view of this financial circumstances, the Applicant is only able to afford $500 for child maintenance once he loses his income.","The Applicant has to file an application to court. Regarding the format of the affidavit, first, the Applicant has to set out the background of his case such as reasons as to why he agreed to the child maintenance sum of $750 per month previously. Second, the Applicant has to state his reasons why he is unable to pay the $750. He should talk about his future employment prospect. He can also include his monthly expenses, financial commitments, loans and bank statements to substantiate his argument that he is unable to pay the $750. Third, the Applicant has to propose to the court how much he can afford to pay for the child maintenances now. For instance, he could ask the court to order the child maintenance to be split in instalments or to be reduced temporarily. Alternatively, the Applicant could discuss the reduction of the child maintenance fee with his ex-wife and come into an agreement."

"Applicant is unable to satisfy the maintenance order, ex-wife is claiming for it. Both parties have undergone mediation. The applicant owes the ex-wife $10,000 in arrears. Further, the applicant' is also unable to pay the children's monthly maintenance of $1,050.","The applicant has to demonstrate to the court his monthly income, Grab expenses, and personal expenses. The applicant should also explain to the court that it is unfair for him to bear the full cost of tuition for all three children alone, especially since this sum was not part of the original maintenance order and the ex-wife is currently employed and earns significantly more than the applicant. It is advised that the applicant should propose a fixed instalment (about $400-$500 per month) to the court and vary the maintenance order. The applicant should also propose that the ex-wife contribute to the tuition fees. The applicant is also advised to approach LAB for further legal aid with regard to the application and filing processes."
"This case is regarding maintenance. Applicant was divorced in 2010 and have to pay a maintenance of $200 to his ex-wife, and $800 to his children. He has been paying for 11 years. However, he has terminal lung cancer at the moment with a doctor's letter. The applicant has been unemployed since August 2021 and is unable to work. The applicant has no income at the moment, and has to pay for his chemotherapy. The children are now 17, living in a 5-room flat with their mother, and the employment status of the wife is unknown.","The lawyer suggests getting the medical documents necessary to file a claim to vary the court order dated 2010 to vary maintenance downwards. The applicant must propose a smaller sum of maintenance (e.g $200 to children and $0 to wife, if the wife is working) and cannot simply claim to pay no maintenance at all. The applicant must list his income (which is zero) and his expenses. The father is supposed to pay maintenance for the children until they are 21, but in the event where he is critically ill the courts can lower the maintenance fees. Adduce medical report and doctor's letter that applicant will be unable to be employed due to his condition. He should make an application to court to vary the court order with regard to maintenance downwards because of his severe illness which renders him unable to work and obtain an income. He should propose in these circumstances for the court to lower the maintenance fee. He cannot purport to be unable to pay anything. Highlight that maintenance should only be paid with respect to the children only since they have yet to reach 21 years of age (could propose $200 a month), as his ex-wife is working and will be able to support herself. Leave it to the court to decide how he should pay. He should put his monthly income and expenses in a table to show that he does not even have enough money to support himself. In preparation for the hearing, the applicant should go to the Legal Aid Bureau to see if he can qualify to solicit a lawyer to help with his case. Alternatively, he has to go to Crimson Logic to file his documents."
"Under a court order, her ex-husband is supposed to pay maintenance for her and her children but has not done so. Although the court order says that she and her ex-husband has joint custody of the children, he ex-husband refused to let her see her children.",The applicant needs to file an application at the Family Justice Court to enforce the order. The court will then fix a day where both she and her husband would go down to the court. She would have to go down to the family justice court with her IC and the court order to make the application.
The applicant's ex-spouse intends to vary the maintenance order made by the court of S$500 per month. He intends to decrease the amount to 0. Their child is 11 years old now. The applicant is concerned that the court may not order the ex-spouse to pay the maintenance due to his current financial situation.,"It is likely that the court may not order the ex-spouse to pay the maintenance. But the applicant could make the point to the court that the maintenance could be adjusted proportionately based on his current income, but if later his income increases, the maintenance should be increased proportionately. And once the ex-spouse is able to withdraw money from his CPF account, he should pay the unpaid amount to the applicant under the maintenance order."
"Applicant is divorced and has been paying maintenance fee to his ex-wife. He recently found out that he paid about $7100 extra in the past 2 years, as his ex-wife did not inform him that the sum due had already been cleared.","Applicant would have to file a summons to vary the maintenance order made. He could ask the court to withhold maintenance for the next couple of months, and only start paying a few months later after the overpaid amount has been cleared. He will have to do the calculations himself to determine how many months the maintenance should be withheld for. For help on the forms, he could visit crimson logic."
"Applicant is not able to pay maintenance of $700 a month to his ex-wife due to legal fees from prolonged legal battle. Legal battle for divorce has been ongoing for the last 6 years. For the last 3 years, ex-wife filed PPO, contempt, bank garnishing, and bankruptcy proceedings against him (ex-wife is currently being charged with contempt) which have been dismissed. Legal fees have reached $50,000, applicant is a grab driver whose salary comes up to around $2000 a month.","Applicant should apply to reduce the maintenance summons and change the access arrangement to see his kid more often (either do it himself or go to a lawyer). Applicant needs to put in an affidavit and include all the details about his financial situation and the proceedings that have taken place. Applicant can try to approach Legal Aid Bureau for legal help. Alternatively, go to the helpdesk at Family Justice Court."
"There is a consent order for maintenance for the child including half of education. Applicant has been required to pay off the bank debt using sale of house, and consequently does not have housing or disposable income.

Asked to pay $15,000 for private education.",Apply for LAB to vary the consent order on the grounds of material change in circumstances.
"The applicant's ex-husband has not paid maintenance for some times. The current maintenance is S$250 per kid which according to the applicant is not enough even for school fees.
The applicant intends to vary the maintenance order.

","When it comes to maintenance, generally, the court would want both parents to contribute to the proceedings, how much to be paid depends on the child's needs and how much they are able to pay. The original sum was based on the fact that he has been earning money, and since he does not have money now, he needs to go to the Syariah court to get the order to be varied, until he has changed the order, he still needs to pay and his wife can still demand him to pay the costs. If the applicant is really unable to pay, he can go to Syariah court to argue and vary the order. It is very unlikely that the court will say that he gives 0, but based on what evidence he adduces, the court will likely vary the order to a more suitable level. 

However, the bottom line is that whatever he should have paid must be paid, but moving forward, he should try and vary the order."

"App obtained court order for child maintenance. Child expenses are higher, so App want to make an application to increase the maintenance. App claimed that ex-husband was not responsive. Apps kids are in Malaysia. They are in primary school - 9 and 7yo. App is working.

App claimed that ex-husband had already paid for the $750.

Court order said that the husband was to pay $250/month (to pay off $9500 outstanding sums), $500/month maintenance.  

App claimed that husband pays $750/month to clear off arrears. 

App wants to increase maintenance to $1200. App says that ex-husband was a property agent and heard that he bought a hdb and run a hawker and hires people. App thinks that for these reasons, ex-husband is better off and should  pay more. He also allegedly collects rent.

 ","The court focuses on 2 factors for maintenance. First is the needs for the kids; second is the ability to meet the needs.

App needs to have proof of these 2 things. 
For needs, the court looks at what sort of needs. At law, there are 2 things - one is essential needs and the other is non-essential needs. Essential means day-to-day necessities (food, healthcare, dental, optician etc.) Non-essentials could be (tuition, enrichment classes). Court favours essential over non-essential needs. 

But bear in mind that the cost of living is lower in Malaysia so proof may be more difficult. Although the court does not have a range, the court is guided by a range. Anything from 9-11 should be around $750/month or slightly more. Court will decide the essential first, before determining who is responsible. For non-essential, court may simply ask the parties to decide, and if can agree, court  will put it in the order.

App has to first categorise essential from non-essential needs, and then negotiate.

For upkeeping of children, liability is joint, but need not be equal. App needs to prepare income statement for both App and her ex-husband. But difficult to get ex-husband to disclose his business. Take a photo of his hawker business. Income tax - has he declared income tax. If not, then can write to income tax. If ex-husband business is properly registered, can write to ACRA. If no ACRA record, his business has a license.

Trace backwards starting from his income tax. See whether his income is more than what he is prepared to  declare.

Applicant pays separately for each child until each child reaches 21 years old. He has not brought his court order.

Applicant used to own a house under his name. After the house is sold, the sales money was given to his ex-wife.

The Applicant is having a hearing next week at the Family Court. His wife is asking for $1000 in maintenance from him but the Applicant does not have the means to pay for maintenance.  He had consulted the legal aid bureau but he was not qualified back then as he was working. ,"The Applicant can apply for a variation of the maintenance to vary downwards, showing that he does not have the means to pay for maintenance. He can support his claim by saying that he is not receiving any income and has little savings. The lawyer also recommended the Applicant to go back to legal aid bureau to see if they can expedite his sharia matter. "
"The applicant divorced with her ex-husband a few years ago and their children had been living with her ex-husband. The applicant has been paying maintenance fees to her ex-husband. The applicant signed an agreement that the maintenance fees ($450) will be paid until all her children turned 18 years old. 

However, due to COVID-19, the applicant is no longer financially able to pay the maintenance fees. The applicant only has one child under the age of 18 years old now. ","The applicant was advised that she may apply to the Family Court to vary the order to reduce the maintenance fees. She was guided on the process of doing so. The applicant was advised that it is not possible to completely stop paying for maintenance fees. 

However, the applicant was also advised to consider settling the matters privately with her ex-husband. "
"The Applicant is a divorcee and he has joint custody for his child. He is paying for maintenance every month and expenses for the child such as school fees, tuition fees etc. ","The lawyer said that the Applicant can file a summon and affidavit.

The daughter is in Applicant's custody since Day 1. 
The younger daughter is 29 years old.","Lawyer recommended that he speak to the mediator later that since the youngest daughter is already 29 years old, he no longer has to pay a maintenance order for the daughter.

Lawyer recommended that he can also put in an application to vary the wife's maintenance order since the fact now has changed as he is a retiree now. "
"Applicant's ex-husband wishes to reduce his children's maintenance to $600 and he accuses her of denying access to his children during the Circuit Breaker period. Applicant has joint custody of the children but she has care and control of her children. 
Her ex-husband is allegedly jobless now and only works part-time. Applicant is now an IT executive at IMH and earns $3,700 per month. 
The latest court order for maintenance is $1194 per month but her ex-husband has always been late for maintenance payments. 
Her ex-husband is now having financial difficulties.
Her children are now 13 and 11 years of age but the order for maintenance was made when they were 12 and 10 years of age.
The deadline for Applicant's filing of affidavit to her husband's application to lower maintenance is today and she has missed it.

Her husband is also seeking access to his two daughters.
Her husband has been physically violent to their daughters when they were younger, around kindergarten age. Her husband also does not call to ask after his daughters on days that he does not have access.","The lawyer has advised Applicant that the court will normally vary the court order if the applicant can show a change in circumstances. Applicant is advised to state in her affidavit that she does not agree to her ex-husband's application to lower maintenance and the children's expenses have increased since the last maintenance order. 
The lawyer has advised Applicant that she can still proceed to file the affidavit despite missing the deadline. She has to file an affidavit to reply her ex-husband if not the court will enter judgement against her. The court will accept her affidavit despite her being late because she has been tied up with work commitments. 
The lawyer has advised Applicant that access is a right that cannot be denied. She can state in her affidavit that she denied access to him because he locked the children up in the room alone while he went out to work. The lawyer has urged Applicant to grant her ex-husband longer day access in lieu of overnight access. Applicant is also advised to state her ex-husband's physical abuse towards her daughters in the affidavit. "
"After divorce, applicant's ex-wife is supposed to pay him $2500/month but he received a letter stating that she will stop paying. Ex-wife is still running the family business, and should by right continue paying since she is supposed to as long as she continues running the business, defaulting on the court order.
Applicant went to Legal Aid for help, but they refused his case.","Since legal aid has already turned him down, he should go to his MP for help to enforce the order for his wife to pay him."
"Applicant has a family court issue. Prior to the 18 December, the applicant and his ex had disagreed on the maintenance. On days leading to 18 December, the applicant and his ex had reached an agreement rendering 18 December unnecessary. On 17 December, applicant checked with his ex whether the mediation session had been cancelled and she said she had cancelled the session. On 18 December, the applicant had checked the Zoom room to check whether there was a meeting and after waiting for 10 minutes, there was no sign of anyone. So, the applicant left the call. He received a warrant to him for not attending the online mediation session on 18 December. Applicant knew of the session but he has reasons to justify why he was not there. Applicant has a hearing on 25 January. ",Applicant should explain to the judge what happened so the judge can cancel the warrant. The applicant has to explain to the judge that the maintenance issue between him and the ex has been resolved. 
"The Court Order given to the Applicant stipulates that she will not get maintenance. However, she asserts that she did not agree to what was written in the Court Order. ","The lawyer recommended to go to the Family Justice Court. The Applicant needs to go to the High Court to get the order. 

The lawyer recommended that the Applicant can vary the Court Order but the likelihood is very slim. Nonetheless, she can try. 

The Applicant should discuss with the lawyer who filed the Court Order. If she does not agree with what the lawyer did, she can file a complaint against the lawyer at the Law Society of Singapore. 

The lawyer recommended for the Applicant to go to the legal aid bureau to open file and the lawyer at the legal aid bureau will correspond with the lawyer who handled the Applicant's case. 

The Applicant can apply to the court to ask for maintenance. The reason is that she never consented to the Court Order. 

"
"The applicant divorced her husband and received an interim judgement, order of court and a

She instructed her legal aid lawyers to ask for the transfer of 2 properties to her in lieu of maintenance. The first lawyer rejected her request. Due to their disagreement, the lawyer discharged himself.

The applicant's second legal aid lawyer was prepared to help her with her request. Ultimately, the lawyer succeeded and the applicant received an order of court. However, there was a problem regarding the return of CPF and she has to now return the accrued interest even though she did not have to pay the capital. 

The second issue relates to the fact that the order stipulates that the transfer of the 2 properties to the applicant has to be done within 6 months. However, due to the circuit breaker, it was not possible to get done.

Thirdly, the applicant wanted to claim for an insurance policy but due to communication issues, it was not mentioned in court. Thus, not included in the order.","The applicant was advised to give her ex husband a copy of the order of court, and also file for a protection order.

Regarding the first 2 issues, the applicant should settle it as soon as possible and hire a new lawyer to help her with those procedural issues. Regarding the third issue, she was advised to settle it separately at a later time."

"The Applicant's ex husband wants to reduce the maintenance fees paid to her Children. She wants to know if this is possible.
She has 2 children aged 25 (son) and 19 (daughter) currently. ","The son needs to apply for maintenance if he wants, since he is above the age of 21.

Daughter: Substantiate the expenses that the applicant has stated. Show receipts for expenses and fees. Argue that as she is older, her expenses have increased since and maintenance should not be reduced.

Maintenance that is owed to the applicant should be referred to enforcement.

At mediation, if the sum is agreed upon, request for a review of the reduced amount."
" The incident happened 5 years ago. The applicant's fifth child passed away in a traffic accident. There was a whole trial and the family insisted on using a certain lawyer. The incident was then settled outside of court. The court judged that the court case was 50-50 liability. The lawyer then appealed to the high court for another judgment. An offer for about $100,000. The applicant had signed on with the army and was 22 years old. Her lawyer said that the case will close by today. ","The lawyer recommends that the applicant goes with his daughter back to their employed lawyer to state that she is not accepting the amount. 

(Note: Applicant registered for Maintenance case but consult ed the lawyer for a civil case instead where she has already engaged a lawyer already)."
"Applicant have two children who are born out of wedlock, aged 7 and 8. The birth cert indicates the name of both the applicant and the children's father. However, they are not married. The children's father is moving on with his life. Even though he had promised to pay for maintenance of the children, his financial support fluctuates. The father had also leased a flat for the children and the applicant. The father has 10 times the salary of the applicant. ","The children are not ""illegal"" but they are ""illegitimate"". 

Since the birth certificates of the children show that the other party is the father. It would be difficult for the children's father to thus avoid maintenance of the children since he has been maintaining them now as well. 

Applicant can apply to court, at any time, for the father to have a fixed maintenance amount. However, there is a cautionary warning that making the order could make the father of the children uncomfortable. 

Alternatively, the applicant could sit down and come to a written agreement with the father of the children to ensure that there is a fixed amount for the children's maintenance. 

The applicant cannot say that the father of the children has to pay a certain proportion of the mortgage or lease of the house that the applicant would stay in with the children. Instead, she has to calculate the children's expenses in housing, education, health etc. for the maintenance sum. The maintenance amount can change as time progresses since expenses would change at different stages of the children's life. The applicant cannot try to get maintenance for herself since she is not the ex-wife of the father of her children.

The applicant still has half the responsibility to pay for maintenance of the children. 

If the father has other children or marries other women, the amount of maintenance to the children could be lessened since the father has more responsibility. "
Applicant is currently applying for annulment and wishes to obtain maintenance from her husband. Maintenance has not been discussed. Uncontested annulment hearing is next month. Husband was the one who filed for annulment.,"1. Applicant can apply for maintenance during the annulment or apply for interim maintenance in the meantime. 

2. Advised Applicant to obtain legal advice to help with maintenance for court proceedings. Also, the maintenance arrangement is unlikely to be considered as uncontested as it has not been discussed. 

3. Advised to communicate with her husband to check about maintenance arrangements. Advised that Applicant can also seek for a lump sum payment from her husband for maintenance and division of assets. Also advised that the sum sought for should be a reasonable sum. 

4. Advised that in general, under Singapore law, there would be no maintenance if Applicant is able to sustain herself with her own income."
"The Applicant attended a Zoom session with the Family Court for the enforcement of maintenance summons. The Applicant applied for enforcement of the maintenance. The ex-Husband has not paid maintenance to the Applicant for 7 to 8 months. 

The ex-Husband (age 72 years) agrees to owe the sums of maintenance for 7-8 months. He says he has no money, but the Judge said he cannot say that. He is unemployed and is unable to work. 

The Applicant proposes to allow him to pay $400 a month, $75 towards the arrears. The Court made an order for this on the 25 September. The ex-husband has not paid even one instalment of the $400. 

The ex-Husband has gone to jail thrice, but he still refuses to pay. He has made a High Court application to rescind the order. ","The maintenance will only stop when the Applicant dies or remarries. The Husband can only successfully rescind the order if he can prove to the court that there is a good reason to rescind it. It does not matter if he remarries. 

The Husband has properties. The Applicant should ask to vary the maintenance order such that the Husband is allowed to pay in other ways. For example, a sum be transferred from his CPF account to the Applicant's CPF account if his CPF account has money. Or, the court can ask him to borrow money to pay off the arrears. 

The Applicant should file another enforcement application of the new order by the Court on the 25th of September 2020. She should go to the Family Court.

The Family Court is waiting for the orders for the High Court. There is no stay of proceedings. 

Since the Husband is represented by lawyers, the Applicant must get lawyers under legal aid. She may qualify for legal aid since she is not working. The lawyers are necessary to prepare written submissions and bundle of authorities.

Applicant received a letter from ex-husband's solicitor for the reduction of maintenance from $800 to $650 monthly. Divorce proceedings have been concluded. The $800 monthly maintenance is ordered from the divorce proceedings and ex-husband is able to make the payment. Ex-spouse is claiming that he has been remarried and is having child with new spouse now. ,"If there are any disagreement with regards to varying the maintenance order, then it will needs to be settled in Court. The Court will need to be satisfied that there must be a material change in circumstance for the ex-husband."
"Applicant wants to file for maintenance order. Applicant's ex husband lost his job as taxi driver and requested children to get the maintenance monies from applicant. Applicant is having the custody, care and control and owns the matrimonial home. ","Court will look at the ratio of the income of the applicant and her ex-spouse. The Court will likely look at enforcing and varying the order for the maintenance order. Applicant should specify the amount of maintenance that the ex-spouse should be paying. If there are any contention, then it should be settled in Court. If the ex-spouse has entered into the consent order, then he should shoulder the responsibility for the commitments. "
"Applicant is a cab driver who has filed for a divorce with his wife.

When they sold the condominium he asked his wife to keep most of his assets. He agreed with his wife to take a certain amount because he intended to use it for his kid's maintenance and to care for his parents should he not have the means to provide it. He also has four outstanding bank loans to settle and his earnings fluctuate.

The wife asked for most of his CPF as well. Last week his wife has called him to ask for maintenance for their living expenses. ","Appeal to family court for a variation on the maintenance fee and demonstrate that he is unable to afford the current fee given his fluctuating salary and obligation to provide for his parents and children. He should declare upfront the range of his salary.

Applicant should go to Legal Aid Bureau to consult a lawyer.

"The applicant is seeking legal advice because she has gotten into a dispute with her boyfriend. She has gotten pregnant with her boyfriend's child unintentionally. She is currently in debt, and this explains why she has gotten into a dispute with him over the costs of her pregnancy.

He wants her to sign a legal document laying clear their respective financial responsibilities for the child but there is a dispute arising over that. Her boyfriend is Italian and not of Singaporean nationality. He is not willing to pay much for the costs of her pregnancy.

Although she is planning to give the child up for adoption, the medical expenses are still heavy.

She is currently on a student pass but has withdrawn from her course recently. She wishes to return to Vietnam soon but she is not able to travel due to her pregnancy. 

The estimated date of her delivery is on 25th Dec 2020. The Vietnamese government has also announced that it will not be accepting any more arrivals from foreign countries, including that of locals, starting from Jan next year, so it is necessary for her to get back to Vietnam as soon as possible. This situation is complicating her case further.","This is a rather difficult situation for the applicant, as there is no legislation binding her boyfriend to the responsibility of paying for her medical costs as they are not married. Although he is bound to take care of their child, by then, it will be too late to claim any fees. 

The lawyer advised her that it is necessary to exert some pressure on her boyfriend. She should first head to the mediation session her boyfriend has arranged with his lawyer, ask for a copy of the agreement and consider if the agreement is worth signing. She may request for a lump sum payment to be included in the agreement. A reasonable amount to request for would be her medical expenses, both for herself and her child, up to the first six months before the child is adopted. 

The Legal Aid Bureau would not be able to help her as she is a foreigner. After the agreement, she may head to the Family Justice Courts to see if she can seek any form of maintenance from her boyfriend. 

She has to ascertain a reliable way to locate her boyfriend so that the court will be able to serve any legal documents on him should that be necessary. 

She can seek assistance from a social worker from a migrant organisation who can provide relevant support considering that she is a migrant and a student. 

If the child is delivered in Singapore, even though the child has been born out of wedlock, the boyfriend is obligated to pay maintenance for the child, but since the boyfriend is a foreigner, it will be difficult to ensure that he does so, even if the relevant court orders are obtained.

"The client currently has a dispute with his ex-wife. They both obtained a divorce in Japan. The both of them had an agreement of $4.5k of maintenance fee monthly. Last year, the defendant, his ex-wife, unreasonably declined access for the client to his kids weekly. Initially the maintenance fee was $6k. There was already an agreement in Japan and he has been fulfilling the fee monthly. If possible, he would like to try to reduce the maintenance fee and he also wants to gain a joint custody for his kids.","The lawyer instructed him to state in the filed affidavit that he wants the maintenance fee to be reduced. He has to take out a new originating summons to ask for joint custody and also for the maintenance fee to be reduced.

The lawyer advised him that he is likely to succeed in terms of seeking joint custody. However, it is unlikely that the maintenance fee will be reduced as his salary is currently $14k. The lawyer agrees that the maintenance fee is still relatively high, thus advises him to try his best to apply through the summons to reduce the amount.

The lawyer also added that the client should request for the wife to disclose the expenses of the child to the court."
"The applicant was divorced in 2010 and had to pay $2000 to his ex-wife. In 2017, he was made bankrupt but he was depressed and suicidal,  and did not apply for variation of court order then. The applicant paid a lumpsum and transferred the matrimonial home in 2010. The ex-wife is relatively well-off and financially stable, owning 2 properties, renting out the matrimonial home and working as a teacher. The applicant tried to file for a variation online after coming out of remand. On 19 November, the applicant filed a variation of maintenance at FJC.  The accumulated arrears come to over $70k. The order was a consent order but his son is now 18 so there can be a sufficiently large change of circumstances to justify the variation.","The applicant can apply to vary the 2010 Court Order from $2000 to a lower specified amount, and can ask for the outstanding arrears to be suspended or terminated. However, it may be difficult to prove his depression in 2017 to justify not applying in 2017. A letter from a medical professional to certify his depression in 2017 would serve as good evidence to prove. The court may give the applicant some leeway if the applicant applies for the variation. All payments have to be made until the Court Order is varied.  The applicant is not working and so may try legal aid and request for expedited help given the urgency of his situation."

The applicant is not eligible for legal aid bureau. The applicant has been paying maintenance diligently apart from the medical bills. ","The lawyer advised the applicant to engage a lawyer to apply for variation but the applicant can apply by himself. However, the lawyer does not recommend that. He advised the applicant to look for law firms and ask for quotes. The maintenance has to be paid until his child is 21.  He can apply for maintenance variation order saying that the child needs lesser money but there is a possibility of the ex-wife being able to prove that she needs more money to take care of the daughter. There is a need to consider extra curricular activities such as tuition. If the daughter does not want to see her father, there are mechanisms in the court.

They made a settlement between themselves for $700 a month. However, because the husband went to Bangkok, the applicant could not apply for the arrears.

Husband is now back in S'pore, and he rents a 3-room flat. He works as a security guard. ","First, under the law, arrears for maintenance is only for 3 years.

Therefore, Applicant must seek leave from the court for an exception to the general rule. This can be done by going to the FJC, and asking them what can be done in cases where the husband absconds.

The applicant can tell the court that she needs a faster process but the workload of the courts is very heavy. Hence, it will be hard to speed up the process. 

The recommended course of action is to go ahead and file the case for maintenance. "

As for variation of maintenance (since the applicant cannot afford the original $1800), this should be done as soon as possible. This also shows the court that the applicant really cannot pay.  Prepare and bring all the documents as part of the affidavit which shows that the applicant is unable to afford the maintenance, and that his ex-wife is earning more.

",To file for variation on the basis that false information was submitted.
"Applicant is going through an uncontested simplified divorce. It is now getting a bit acrimonious. Applicant is the plaintiff and was represented till August 2019 and discharged the lawyer since he lost his job. Wife has been assigned lawyers from legal aid. 

Parties are agreeable to share joint custody of their children, wife has care and control of younger child and he has care and control of older child. 

Marriage lasted 4 years. They have no assets to split. Wife is asking for $400 maintenance for the child who is in her care and control and $1 nominal maintenance for herself. Applicant is currently not working. 

Applicant did not file an affidavit because he is not comfortable releasing his financial data to his wife and her lawyers. He is also not willing to pay $400 maintenance and intends to simply not pay even if the court decides in wife's favour.

Wife also wants $40k from applicant's CPF account. ","Applicant cannot just refuse to pay maintenance, he will go to jail. Even if he is unemployed, he has a duty to maintain his children. If he does not pay, wife will go to court and get it enforced. The court will not waive the maintenance must because he is unemployed and will give him some time to pay the arrears. If he still refuses to pay, they will throw him in jail. They do not care for his excuses.

As a parent, he has a duty to care for his child. It doesn't matter whether or not he is going through a divorce right now. The court will have to make a maintenance order. If he thinks $400 is too much, he can propose a suitable sum to the court. Applicant cannot simply say he doesn't want to pay anything. 

Applicant can also ask his wife to maintain the child who is under the applicant's care and control. It might work out that the maintenance cancel out. 

Applicant needs to submit an affidavit. Because applicant did not disclose his assets, they will draw an adverse inference that he has assets. Applicant can try to go to legal aid and get a lawyer to help him draft an affidavit. If applicant refuses to disclose his assets, he will be penalised and court may make him pay more maintenance. 

If he tells the court he wants to disclose his assets and file an affidavit, he can say he is a layperson and didn't understand the situation and consequences of not submitting an affidavit of means earlier even with an extension. He will likely be able to file his affidavit. They will then call for another PTC so that the court can make proper directions. If the court refuses to grant a PTC or wife's counsel oppose it, he can go before the district judge in his next hearing and tell the judge that he is willing to disclose his assets but was rejected. This way, an adverse inference will not be drawn against him. If he applies for legal aid and qualifies, it also shows that he is not a man of means and an adverse inference should not be drawn against him due to his failure to disclose his assets. 

For a short marriage, the amount that the wife should get is pretty low. Wife is making a charging order against his CPF because she knows he has no money. $40k is too much, he should dispute this quantum. He should be careful of the language he uses in court. He cannot say that wife did absolutely nothing as a stay-home mom. Court has the discretion to decide what is a fair amount and will have the final say. "
Ex-wife filed for an enforcement for maintenance. The husband did not file sufficient evidence in the affidavit because he only managed to retrieve evidence after the 14-day deadline. Judgement was passed for the husband to pay up for the maintenance cost. There was also evidence that the wife agreed informally to the word 'henceforth'. The husband wants to appeal.,"The husband should file for an extension of time for appeal. The husband must appeal for leave and should also apply for stay so that the court cannot enforce the claim in the time being. The husband must justify why he did not have the evidence before and that is why he wants to be granted leave. One of the grounds he should state is that he did not know what was considered sufficient evidence. Another ground is that he can state that he was waiting for an outcome for his application for a rescission order. If it is granted leave, he can appeal. He can also appeal on the premise that the judge made a wrong judgement on the word 'henceforth'. 

The husband has to pay a deposit as security. "
"The applicant is inquiring regarding child maintenance. She and her ex-husband agreed to each provide maintenance for their two children. Her ex-husband has not fulfilled his maintenance obligations for one of their children. The child is temporarily staying with the applicant, and the applicant has been paying the telephone bill for this child for the past 9 months. She has proof of this payment. ","The applicant can apply to enforce against his breach of his Maintenance Order, under clause (e) (""each party must maintain the child under the respective care and control""). Concurrently, she can also apply to vary the order for the clause to list the specific areas of maintenance, including the telephone bills. Alternatively, she can apply to vary the care and control of both children to herself.

She would first have to approach a Commissioner for Oath who is a lawyer, who cannot be the same lawyer who had acted for her in the divorce proceedings. However, she can hire him to act for her subsequently. If not, she can file her own summons and affidavits at CrimsonLogic. "
"Issue 1: Applicant is filing for more money for maintenance costs. 

From October 2019 to now, her hospital bills are increasing, and she wants to get more money. The judge says that she should bring the bills for her doctor appointments. At the second trial, the judge dismissed the case. 

In the first case when she was dealing with the maintenance, she did not put all the costs for her maintenance initially as her husband paid for her flights to overseas three times a year for medical care. However, her husband no longer wants to pay for the flight tickets, and now she has to get it done in Singapore. As a result, the hospital fees are increasing.

The court stated that these fees should have been indicated in the first maintenance order, and that there was no need to increase maintenance costs now. 

Issue 2: Applicantr's phone contract is under her husband's name. She has been paying him the monthly bill for her phone bills. Her husband has terminated the telephone line, and there is a termination fee of $700. He wants to deduct the maintenance fee of $700 from her maintenance fees. ","Issued 1: 
Volunteer lawyer advised that she should get legal representation. Since the application has been dismissed, she has 14 days to appeal.  One possible way is to file an appeal directly if she disagrees with the court, and to get a lawyer to help assess whether there is any chance of the appeal succeeding, and for the lawyer to present the case properly. 

If she chooses not to engage a lawyer, she can still do it by herself, but she has to present that there has been a material change in circumstances to justify the increase in maintenance costs. 

Lawyer advised that it is better to engage a lawyer if she can afford it, as they would be able to better help her navigate the entire process. It would be important to check with them how strong the chances of appealing would be. 

Issue 2: 
Volunteer lawyer advises that there should not be a basis for him to deduct the $700 from her maintenance. 

Lawyer advised that if she does not want to engage a lawyer, it is possible for her to represent herself. 

Lawyer advised that she could ask around for private lawyers, and to look for a family lawyer.

"Regarding an enforcement of maintenance order from Applicant's (App) ex-wife. 

App attended mediation online. Enforcement order is for $2300 a month for the expenses of 3 children. App had not agreed to $2300/month but as of date, the total arrears is a sum of around $8000 which the App disputes. 

App is a teacher and his monthly income had dropped from $9000 to $7000 and has been facing problems at work since the start of the year. This has created uncertainty in his finances. 

The access order is for 9 am to 9 pm on Saturday. The ex-wife has on her accord changed the access to 2 pm to 7 pm. For school holidays, App is to arrange with the ex-wife to bring the children on trips. However, she has made it difficult for the App. 

The access order also provides for telephone access but ex-wife did not provide the App with the home phone number and the children do not pick up when the App calls. 

","Advised App that his income bracket renders him ineligible for legal aid but should seek legal representation. 

At the current stage, Court may next direct App to file an affidavit. 

While waiting for the Court's directions, App should apply to vary the maintenance order using his current uncertain financial status as a reason, while providing the documentary evidence. "

Applicant needs to show ""material change in circumstances"". Also advised that Husband has last right of reply and hearing will be fixed."
The applicant wants to file a variation of maintenance order for her children. She wishes to understand more about the process and procedures involved. Both parties did not have a lawyer with them at the second stop of the divorce proceedings 5 years ago. ,"The applicant has to make an application by summons with supporting affidavit filed in the original suit under which the order was made. In other words, the applicant has to draft her summons and affidavit according to her divorce documents, e.g. the plaintiff party has to be the same as that under the divorce documents, and the reference number is that of the divorce case. She has to refer to the exact maintenance order in her documents to state the amendments she wishes to make. The supporting evidence for her claim has to be included in her affidavit. 

The applicant has to file her papers at CrimsonLogic, and she has to subsequently collect documents there as well. Any follow-up procedures on mediation, etc, will be mailed to her personal address if she is acting in person.

The counterparty has 14 days to reply once she serves the documents on him. To ensure proper service, she should serve the documents on him via multiple ways, such as registered post, email, and/or meeting him in person. 

At the pre-trial conference, the court will direct the applicant as to what other documents and arguments she will have to present for her case. "
"Applicant's wife filed for divorce and has settled matters of the children's maintenance. He is now seeking advice regarding division of assets. Applicant's wife has engaged a lawyer and volunteer lawyer explained that wife's lawyer would soon ask for discovery and applicant is required to file a Reply Affidavit within 14 days. Volunteer lawyer also suggested that samples for the forms can be found on the family court website. 

Applicant would also like to ask about CPF divisions and the volunteer lawyer explained that the courts would usually look at the length of marriage in deciding these matters. ","Applicant's wife has been residing in India for the past 5 years but filed for divorce in Singapore and most of what the wife has mentioned (property, children) took place in India. Applicant asked if it is possible to transfer the case to overseas.

In the event that the ex-wife misuses the personal information, they would need to rely on criminal law. 

It is hard to say whether the reduction would be approved. It depends on what the ex-wife would raise. Also, he has to raise new circumstances which make it difficult for him to pay now. If they want to apply again if it fails this time, they need to show very good reasons. 

Access to the child is a separate matter. "
"There was a deed of separation done previously. She wants to continue with a divorce. He has been defaulting on his maintenance fees and also borrowed money from her. She has also been receiving calls on the money he has been borrowing. 

","Since there was already a deed of separation, it is likely it won't be contested and the divorce proceedings would be done smoothly.

He is starting a new business (with his dad's assistance) and only earns $1800/month.

Furthermore, he states that his wife consistently does not allow him to meet with his child (during the Court mandated visitation period).","Applicant will need to apply for a variation of the Child Maintenance amount. Given that he has a material change in circumstances

It is common courtesy (as well as to protect himself) to notify his ex-wife of the change in his circumstances and his inability to pay the full maintenance sum (as well as his application to vary the maintenance amount).

For the visitation issues, Applicant must apply to the Court to compel his wife to allow him to see his son during the visitation period. Even though the Court process might be lengthy, it sends a message to the ex-wife that she must allow him to exercise his Court mandated visitation rights. Otherwise, his ex-wife would be deemed to have flouted the court order (divorce order)."
"Applicant wants her ex-husband to pay for the child maintenance (as granted in the divorce order). In the divorce settlement, he agreed to pay for the son's phone (or replacement if the phone was faulty and not able to be repaired). However, the ex-husband had been very reluctant to agree to this clause during the divorce, and Applicant feels that he is trying to breach the agreement.

The son's phone broke and Applicant asked her husband to pay for the new phone. He did not reply Applicant until a month later. By that time, Applicant had already bought a new phone for her son. The ex-husband asked for the faulty phone to be provided to him before he would be willing to pay. 

Applicant has traded in the old phone and wants to know if she can force her husband to make payment for the new phone.","Due to the wording of the divorce settlement, the ex-husband is only liable to pay for the phone if it is ""incapable of repair"". There is a possible argument that the old phone might have been able to be fixed and therefore the ex-husband is not liable to pay for the new phone.

Applicant should call her husband to have a chat (as the cost of enforcement will be expensive), or take him to Court if he is unwilling to pay (although the wording of the clause may be tricky).

Also, Applicant's divorce order had no ""liberty to apply"" clause, which will allow her to return to court to apply for the execution of the order. There may be a possibility that returning to court will be difficult."

If applicant were to divorce, then the court will do apportionment with regard to the matrimonial assets. With regard to her property that is in her name but paid fully by the husband, she is holding the property in trust for her husband. He will get the share of the property regardless. Best way forward is to get a lawyer since it's not maintenance which she is concerned about, it's also about the matrimonial assets. "
"Applicant and his wife are separated.

2. Custody issue: Keep a record to show that he is not an absent parent and justify the care and concern, before taking out an Originating Summons to get care and concern/access of the son. However, take note that divorce is around the corner, so whatever orders which come out of divorce proceedings would supersede this application.   

3. Alternative: He can take the initiative to get a lawyer to file for divorce himself if he feels that the marriage cannot be saved. He could consider Legal Aid Bureau. "

"She has already divorced her ex-husband on September 2019. She has a child. However, she has since then found out that her husband may have had a child outside their marriage previously. ","She may not have a course of action as both parties have already divorced. Therefore, even if he had committed adultery previously, there is nothing she can do about it.

Husband would encourage and persuade the children to stay with him and he has led them astray (1 of them cut himself, needs to see psychotherapist etc). Ever since the older child turned 21, the ex husband has stopped his son's maintenance and the son has been telling the mother that she should let him stay with his father. She is worried about her son who is seemingly unwilling to study. Her husband is not paying her own maintenance, and she does not know what to do. Got health issue, can't remember things that happen (does not what is the day's date etc), not sure if these will affect.  ","When the child turns 21, the child will have to make an application on his own if he would want maintenance to continue. Should sit her son down one day and ask him whether he wants to study or not, explain the whole situation to him as well.

With regard to the maintenance order, technically speaking, she can try to enforce the order until he decides to challenge.

She can explain about her current situation, and her expenses. His high monthly expenses is also debatable. "

He also has not given any other evidence other than the CPF statement (e.g. bank statement) to justify his unemployment. But even this does not preclude the possibility that he gains income from self-employment. Number the paragraph and pages and attach evidence as Exhibits behind the document. After filing, she has to send the counterparty a copy of her affidavit.

Counterparty is not allowed to pay a reduced amount of $500 before the court order is varied. Thus the shortfall from the past payments would have to be paid up by him as well.

The wife is working as a tuition tutor. He acquired two properties overseas. He thought that his family could live on the two rental properties ($2,000/month).

The applicant's wife (""Wife"") started to alienate the applicant. Wife even approached the police in 2017 to report that he had been violent. Wife applied for a PPO. The PPO was granted to both the applicant and the wife, but not to the child.

The applicant says it is not violence. Wife came out with a maintenance summons for her and the child.","Out of job for two years. The applicant's indirect contributions do not extend to the whole house; he only cleans up his portion. From 2017, he has ceased to eat with his family. The rental income came in from 2017. For one of the apartments, one of the tenants left in 2019. For the other apartment, the money keeps going.

Under SG law, parents have a duty to provide for the child. A woman can also get maintenance for herself. In the applicant's case, the rental amount have been given to her all this while - already maintaining her.

First, put together a chronology about how you have financially supported her, and how even now the money from both the apartments are still going to her. Next, need to include about how she has a job and assets. Last, need to state that you are unemployed.

For the child, Wife is asking for $1,200. Of this $1,200, $500 is supposedly intended for tuition. The court will want to know what is a reasonable amount for the child. So you should figure out what you think is reasonable. And you also want to say that right now, you have been contributing but right now you have limited means.

The problem about using the rental income as child maintenance is that if the apartments are not rented."
"Applicant is a permanent resident and had a divorce a while ago. 
The maintenance given by the ex husband to the applicant was once every 3 months instead of once a month.
On the days that the applicant is given access to the children, the ex husband had arranged for the children to have tuition on those days of the week.
",The lawyer advised the applicant to vary access and enforce the maintenance order against the ex husband.
"Client's husband is a SG citizen. She has been separated from him for 7 years, and they are not married. They have a child together. They were supposed to get married, but his family has opposed the marriage. 

She now wants to know whether there is anything she can do in terms of requesting for maintenance. ","The best course of action is to negotiate with the father of her child. 

In the event that she does want to make an application to the family court, she should engage a lawyer. If she can prove that the father is indeed the biological father, then there should be no issue in obtaining a maintenance order. 

No legal method to force the husband to look after her son in Singapore. "
"Applicant given a court order relating to maintenance and is seeking clarification with regard to interpretation of the order. Under the order, applicant is not awarded maintenance but her daughter is.

Not being awarded maintenance (not even nominal) extinguishes applicant's right to maintenance altogether, meaning she would not be entitled to vary this and apply for maintenance in the future. However, subsequent part of the order gives applicant liberty to apply should circumstances change, meaning she would be able to apply. As such both parts contradict.

She is concerned as she feels she may need to apply for maintenance in the future due to problems at work and personal injuries.","Lawyer agrees that this is an unconventional wording of the order and that it is inherently contradictory. Typically, applicant should be given nominal $1 maintenance to entitle her to the right to apply to vary the maintenance should she need to. However, applicant is still encouraged to apply and rely on the part of the order that appears to give her the liberty to apply if the circumstances were appropriate. 

Should she make an application now, the new judge may be able to make reference to the previous judge's notes in interpreting the order. The previous judge's notes would probably have captured the intentions behind her order. Applicant can also contact her old lawyer to clarify.

May face difficulties as applicant's earning power appears to be higher than her ex-husband's on paper.

Can make an application to give up care and control and explain well in her affidavits regarding the kind of abuse the child has been inflicting on her."
Divorced previous spouse. Has corresponding maintenance orders etc. He wants to do a variation (reduction of maintenance payable) and would like to know more about the process and procedure involved for his case. ,"Explained the legal process for a variation order to the Applicant. 

May request for a refiling of affidavit at the case conference. But it is likely that both sides would have to access these documents in the process for the variation order being sought. 

If a negotiation is successful, Applicant can still record what was agreed on as a consent order. However, he should withdraw his current application.

"The applicant's dad was abusive, and charged for murder for killing the applicant's mom. The father is seeking maintenance from the applicant and his brother.

He had applied to the tribunal 3 times but it was dismissed. The application was deemed to be vexatious and frivolous. 

Thus, the applicant wants to know whether the father is entitled to seek maintenance from the applicant.","The children are bound to provide maintenance to the parent but whether the court will look at the circumstances.

Wait for the father's lawyer to serve the letter on the applicant and inform them. The father's lawyers will have to send the applicant's directives. Respond and rebut factually to the allegations made. 

It is unlikely that the application to the tribunal will be approved."
Applicant would like to apply for variation of child maintenance. ,"1. Monthly maintenance per child:
For varying the amount, you need to provide proof of the request. Why this amount is justified. You need to explain that any increases is fairly shared. Currently, husband is required to pay $1080 ($540 per child per month). 

Ex-husband is also entitled to argue that the maintenance should not be increased or even lowered. He could argue that he can no longer afford it (i.e. earning less now).

2. Reimbursement clause:
Current arrangement is ""reimbursement for 2018 / 2019 for medical expenses"". Husband did not pay. The court order for enforcement has already been taken out, so no issue here. Unfortunately, have to keep chasing periodically.

"Applicant's ex-spouse (A/P) has not been paying maintenance and has recently filed for Variation of Maintenance to reduce the sum he has to pay. The maintenance sum includes the outstanding property loan that both parties share. Applicant wishes to oppose the variation as she would not be able to afford the loan on her own due to the fact that she has to pay for her medical fees (heart attack).

A/P is the sole owner of the matrimonial property, which Applicant claims is his only asset (he has no cash and is unemployed). A/P is living in that property now with his mother.","Applicant is advised to file a Summons for Enforcement to counter A/P's variation.

"Client would like to increase maintenance for her children. Right now maintenance has been deducted because children turned 21, subsequently further deducted $150 because children are no longer staying with her. This is based on his own calculations and done despite court order still stipulating him to pay the original amount ($1151).

Client would be out of job after 12 Jan so she needs the maintenance.

Client is also currently owed $150.","File an application to the Family Court to vary the court order. Not necessary to hire a lawyer as procedure is not complicated.

Advised to request for the particular paragraph in the original order to be amended to the amount of maintenance she now wants to claim.

Required to explain to the court why she now wishes to request for a higher sum and support it with documents and evidence to better persuade the court. Give a specific breakdown on the costs to justify the sum requested and to amend the order. Can find articles showing how inflation is now a very real issue. Also justify increasing the current nominal maintenance for herself by explaining that she is going to be out of job.

The $150 owed should be paid as the current order is still standing. Doesn't matter if it is already paid to the son as the amount is supposed to be paid to her directly especially since he often delays payment. Amount paid to the son to be treated as extra. This can be raised during the upcoming mediation session she is going to attend. Can also ask to amend the current arrangement (still half-half but him paying first and she reimbursing him after), but this similarly has to be supported by evidence that he always takes long to pay her back which makes cash flow tight for her."
"Applicant's wife is seeking an interim maintenance order against him. Applicant has been drawing a salary of about $1,700 per month since September 2019. He was terminated from his former job due to family troubles and being locked out of the house by his wife. Applicant's wife is working with a salary much higher than his.

They have also instructed the security to bar the Applicant entry. and prevented her access to her son. Previously, the Applicant allowed her in-laws to take care of her child. The police declined to assist the Applicant, advising her to resolve matters internally. 

On a separate issue, the in-laws and her ex-husband have refused to give the Applicant the maintenance monies owed to her, as she has sole access of the children. ","Lawyer advised her to go to the legal aid bureau. There, the lawyers will likely assist her in issuing letters that will call her ex-in-laws to mediation.

","Difficult for her to get money from the natural father, because there is no proof that he is the father and it is difficult to prove this. The court will not order that he take a DNA test.

"Client's husband failed to pay Client maintenance for past two months, claiming that he is required to spend on his new family. Client's husband is a director, and owns three properties.

Client is terminally ill, and has drafted her will. She is therefore worried that she won't be around to enforce the order of maintenance for her children.","Client was advised that it would be difficult to force the ex-husband to pay a lump sum, since ex-husband is unlikely to be financially able to pay this lump sum. Additionally, it may not be strategic to force a lump sum now, since she may vary maintenance upwards in the future. Client, or whoever she has appointed as the guardian of her children, must wait for every instance in which ex-husband fails to pay maintenance, and thereafter bring him to court to enforce the order.

"Client's ex-wife has taken out a summons against him for enforcement of arrears in maintenance. Client has recently changed his job and is facing financial difficulties and as such, Client has been paying a lesser amount for maintenance since last June.

","This would be a good evidence that his wife have committed adultery. There must be concrete evidence to show that there was adultry. (eg if she checks into the hotel alone, this is not sufficient)

Second, the court is unlikely to separate the children. The court will consider based on evidence in which who owns the custody of the children.

Lastly, in terms of maintenance, if the applicant is earning as much as his wife, might not be required to give to his wife. However, in terms of their children, both would have to contribute towards their expenses. Such contribution should be of reasonable amount, meaning that the wife cannot enrol their children in excessive enrichment classes, or classes of unreasonable prices and thereafter expects the applicant to pay for them.

In terms of custody of the child, as his wife wants things to remain in the current state where her parents get to see the children everyday, applicant is advised that the court would not look at grandparents' right. Would prioritise parents rights. Hence, it may not be possible for the grandparents to see their grandchildren everyday after their divorce. "

"The applicant, a HR employee (PR status in Singapore), has just received the verdict on her maintenance under the family court. The applicant filed a PPO against her husband,  prior to the court hearing and filed for a maintenance summons in January 2019. After the PPO was filed, the husband only paid $2,500 for the maintenance of the shared condominium rental amount. The verdict of the family court case did not go in the applicant's favour; the court did not grant the applicant any amount of maintenance. The applicant's income is $12,500 a month, whilst her husband's income is soon to be $30,000 a month from an overseas job offer. The applicant is currently under physiotherapy and psychological therapy to treat her depression from her husband's infidelity and physical actions, as well as IVF treatments to preserve her ability to conceive. 
","The lawyer states that since the applicant earns $12,500 a month, she cannot claim for an extravagant maintenance of $6,000 under the court. Maintenance is defined as an individual's needs to support their necessary livelihood and immediate expenses. The lawyer states that the applicant has to file for a notice of appeal against the maintenance order by going to the Crimson Logic Office (19th Floor of Chinatown Point) to initiate the appeal process and has 14 days to do so from today.

","1. He needs to give you at least $2000 for maintenance. 

2. Apply for maintenance first. Divorce is a step that you should consider later.

3. Apply for guardianship. This will allow you to have an easier time to get your children into school etc. Guardianship is an application you take before you divorce. You want sole custody of the children and you will give access to him on certain days.  This way you will be able to have care and control of your children. Since you do know his overseas residential address, your lawyers can serve the papers to him overseas 

3. Engage an overseas lawyer to serve the papers to him. You need to increase the maintenance for your 4 month old, 2 years old and 3 1/2 years old. Explain the difficulties you currently face. Papers are to be served at the Family Justice Court.

4. Get medical insurance plans for your 3 children.

5. Go to legal aid for help. LAB.

6. Yes you can get your divorce here since you are Singaporean. However, if he does not pay maintenance, it would be difficult to enforce the judgment. Enforce it on his employers but it would be very technical and costly in terms of legal costs. 

7. It is not illegal for him to come to SG to take the children and bring them out of the country. You need to get the care and control of your children now. He does not even come to SG to see his children. It is more likely for you to retain care and control of the child."

"Applicant's ex-wife filed for divorce. This was because of violence at home, where he threw an object which subsequently injured his ex-wife. He subsequently attempted suicide but failed. He engaged two lawyers, the former did not want to take up his case. Applicant agreed to pay a certain amount of maintenance to his three children (80% as agreed with his lawyer). The wife is now claiming that he has not paid the maintenance fee regarding his third child. The Judge allowed for the PPO and the maintenance. According to the Court Judgment, his ex-wife has to sell the house and split the profits. However, she has not done so as of this date.

Applicant does not want to appeal, but would like someone to review this judgment.","Applicant cannot get people to review the judgment, but must find reasonable grounds to make amendments. One ground is to argue that his ex-wife has, as of this moment, not sold the property as stated in the Judgment, and should therefore appeal because the court order has not been followed."
Final judgement was made on 3rd January this year. This is a very unfair judgement. The client can set aside this order if she can have medical proof of her depression.

This should have been taking into account to the husband's assets and money. ,"Take up legal proceedings immediately. Legal Aid Bureau.

"Applicant wishes to enforce maintenance from ex husband (first time) for her children. The order has been made for 2,000 for each child monthly, and nominal sum of $1 for applicant. Arrrears of 271,000.

Applicant has written lawyer letter to ex-husband to pay up this amount, but ex-husband has written another lawyer letter to say he has fulfilled this by paying school fees etc. 

They were officially divorced in 2011/2012. When he comes back every weekend in Malaysia, they still stayed in the same house. They got back together as a couple up till 2014. Thus, Applicant thought that things would go back to normal and did not wish to chase him for money during that period. ","Ex-husband has made such payments gratuitously. Behind the tabulation that she has done, she has proof (bank account), and bring this along to substantiate. At some point he may put forward his computation and say that by paying for school fees etc I would have paid so much, but Applicant can say that he did not say that he will offset this from the monthly maintenance payroll- he could have discussed with applicant or just pay the monthly payable so that Applicant can pay the school fees from the maintenance. 

Applicant can only claim up to 3 years back from date of filing with family court. But if she has very good reason, the judge might allow beyond 3 years. Applicant should put forward as best as possible. By reconciling, applicant would have impliedly waived the amount given to her. Her conduct represented that she would forgive and forget. 
Another good reason would be that they were having negotiations and discussions, and was led to believe that they would make good on the arrears, but it appears that this did not occur. If it does not work, at least applicant is mentally prepared to get the remaining sum of money.

When meeting the other lawyer, should at least have computation table and bank statements to show for each month and a copy of the order of court. 

During trial, need to convince the judge that that is the amount owed. "
"Applicant is currently unemployed and searching for a job, 61 years old. 
Applicant has three properties which are rented out. He is paying mortgage for those properties jointly with his wife. He used to manage around five factories overseas and is a technical director for an academic institution. His wife provides for him. He has two children. Applicant had previously requested for copies of the son's birth cert for estate planning, but this request was rejected by the son's mother. 

Applicant has a summons for child maintenance from a third party. The applicant has a son outside of his marriage who is 19 years old (before he got married to his current wife). The son is serving NS and likely will be pursuing an education in university. Applicant has not been supporting this child for the past 19 years. 2 years ago, the applicant was contacted by the son's mother's friend and they made up. Applicant gave his personal funds ($28,000) which he had gained from an insurance claim to the son for his studies. The circumstances in which the son's mother found out about this windfall is uncertain: The applicant is not sure how or why the son's mother came to find out about this sum.  Even after giving the funds he has not met the son. Applicant is unsure if the son's mother is married, but the understanding currently is that the son's mother is not. Applicant has been working overseas for these years, and the last time the Applicant met the son was in 2007. There has been intermittent contact between Applicant and the son, one time being in 2013 through a letter from MINDEF sent to his address for the 19 year old son. 


Applicant is not working, and wishes to resist summons for maintenance. Applicant is going for a mediation session soon.

","Applicant will need to identify his financial circumstances and provide financial documents (CPF/IRAS statements, other loans etc, and highlight the history of how he has contributed to the son (establish how he has not traditionally been the caregiver of the son), and how the son's mother has been the one raising the son. Regarding the financial documents, Applicant should highlight all relevant documents regarding income streams, loans and other documents and be ready to explain his financial circumstances. Generally a father is responsible for his child under 21 years of age, subject to individual circumstances. 

Applicant will go for mediation, and should it fail then court proceedings will have to be undertaken. Generally when there is a child outside of marriage, responsibility still falls on the applicant to provide for the child. Applicant should possibly provide for alternatives but he is not required to promise anything. Applicant has liberty to decide a mutually beneficial outcome during meditation. Applicant has the option to plead for a monthly maintenance instead of a lump sum payment during mediation, and can ask for access to the son. Suggestion that Applicant should try to resolve issues during mediation stage as opposed to reverting to court proceedings as it is unknown what a judge could order.  

Noted that the sum given of $28,000 will be a point for the court to consider when assessing the amount for maintenance. This sum weighs heavily for the applicant and thus should be raised. 

Applicant had a specific question of whether the court will order him to sell his three properties at an undervalue (market value is currently not that high) to pay for a lump sum quantum of maintenance. Lawyer noted that there is a possibility of this occurring (a possibility of the court ordering the applicant to find a way to finance the maintenance). "
"Request for advice on varying maintenance order
Lost job two years ago and has been doing a part-time driving job
has been paying maintenance for 10 years
$3000 or more per month
One lump sum maintenance split between ex-wife plus son (who is now 18 years old)
He has even sold his insurance policies to maintain this amount


","So long as you can show material change of circumstances - from the time the order was made until now
The big drop in income should already be considered a material, substantial change
It could be yours or hers income change (eg she was not previously working but is now working)
Remarriage, got different things (eg looking after parents)
That at the time the court made the order didn't exist or was a small factor
For him - need to provide documentary evidence - what job he had, when he lost, current salary - something to show there is a drop and he's not able to pay
Also his son was 9 and now he's 18 (in poly) - father thinks he will probably get a scholarship - he's quite independent - except if he needs to go overseas
Ex-wife has always worked as a secretary for uob - has a new condo/car since divorce.
Have to show his situation has changed, and also can if he wishes to show that her situation has changed
She will also have to give an explanation of her circumstances

The only thing that might come up- you have not been in arrears - 
but he can say he did not want to be in arrears and sold his insurance
and was not aware that he apply to vary the order
 
At the moment he doesn't really need a lawyer - can go to family justice court - ask for summons for variation - they will give sample
affidavit which is his statement
Just put his situation.

Make sure put current income, current expenses, how he's been paying maintenance - show examples of how he sold insurance policies -
Put it to the court - and propose how much he wants to pay

Once the affidavit has been put in, they will serve it on her. up to her to get a lawyer or not to attend for her. 

For him also good not to get lawyer - given the possible impression that he can then afford a lawyer 

If she objects she will file an affidavit to counter

Lawyer thinks will probably succeed but he'll just have to think how much he would want it to be reduced

He can put in the affidavit that while he so far has not been falling into arrears, he does not wish to be.

It can be three weeks to a month post filing that you get a hearing date.

There could also be the possibility of mediation.

He recommends retaining the separation  - for mother and son - since when son starts working may not need maintenance. 

It's for him to say that from his observations her situation has improved (new condo, car) - maybe she got another job, man etc. So let her rebut you.

So now just go to FJC to ask for a summons for downwards variation of his maintenance.

(Instructions on affidavit)
He was originally defendant in the action, put in reasons for application. Get commissioner for oaths from any law firm. Normally for commissioner for oaths they charge $25 and $5 per exhibit. He will need an Exhibit sheet behind which he can put his documents. (Alternatively can also get lawyer to do the paperwork and he can show up in court himself).  Also please keep it simple (consistent with his educational standard). Normally for variation, would be about $3,000 from a small firm (including court appearance) - but if just engaging them for paperwork, should be maximum $1,500. 
(Query whether can get these templates online) - should be. 

Also warning that she might counter - a common strategy - she will file for upward, with the result that the court might maintain status quo.

Ex-husband has been paying maintenance on and off (with Applicant applying for enforcement with the FJC) to a point where the ex-husband got into prison 

Ex-husband also has not made the effort the see the children at all despite them calling him on festivals etc. So Applicant wants to apply for sole custody ","Because the ex-husband has been in jail, he is in halfway house and he is unemployed, he is most likely able to suspend the maintenance because he truly does not have the means to pay the maintenance 

Apply for a variation in Court Order since she wants the Court Order to be changed from joint custody to sole custody but it will be difficult to obtain because in order to get sole custody, the Applicant must be able to prove very extreme and detriment acts by the Father to the Court (eg. sexual assault, physical abuse) then the Court will award
If the Applicant applies for sole custody now, it might backfire in the sense where the Court will order that the Applicant bring the children to DSSA where there will be supervised access and they will work towards the father's unsupervised access because being in prison can be an ""excuse"" in a sense where he is in prison and that is why he cannot see the children "
"Applicant has a HDB letter which is a transfer of ownership. A/P is the ex husband of the applicant. They have a 21 year-old son and a 20 year-old daughter. 

Applicant received a HDB loan. The HDB has approved.  The order has not been sent to the CPF board. applicant and A/P are in a communication term. 

After July 2019, A/P claims not to provide any maintenance to the son. ","HDB will not act for applicant.The HDB does not want to get involve in a division of assets. Therefore, applicant need to engage a lawyer. The lawyer will liaise with the HDB and CPF to transfer. A/P may also need to engage a lawyer. 

Applicant could go to the family court due to the child has not been finishing education to improve himself in life. Therefore, A/P may need to provide a maintenance to him due to education needs. "
"Applicant is already divorced and she wants to apply for a variation of the Court Order.
Court Order states that her ex-husband will pay for the kids' secondary school fees and an exact amount is stated in the Order. Now that one of the kids have progressed to tertiary education, the school fees have increased and she would like more maintenance correspondingly. ","Write an affidavit to state the reasons why she wants to vary the Court Order and she will have to exhibit certain documents to show the increase in school fees (or anything else she is applying for) 
She cannot leave it to the Court to decide on the quantum because that will not be varying, she has to tell the Court what she wants 
She just needs to mention in the affidavit the reasons why she wants to vary what she wants to vary (ie. maintenance, contribute more to the kids' school fees) because of change in circumstances
Can ask for costs also "
"Applicant is already divorced and a Court Order has been obtained 
Court Order states that once the Applicant and daughter moves out, he is supposed to pay $2,000 to the daughter into an account designed by the Applicant until she turns 18. The monies will be given to the daughter thereafter. 
Ex-husband's lawyer emailed her to tell her that he wants 1/3 of the monies to be deposited into an account designed by him because he feels like the Applicant will use the monies for herself instead of keeping the monies for the daughter 
Ex-husband also stated in the email that if the matter is escalated to Court, he will claim for costs of the application against her ","Ex-husband will have to apply to Court for a variation of the Court Order and it is subject to the Court's discretion whether his requests will be acceded to 
If her ex-husband does apply to Court for the variation, a summons will be served on the Applicant together with an affidavit to state reasons why a variation was applied for. Upon which, the Applicant will have to do up a reply Affidavit by 14 days to object to the grounds (+ state reasons for objection) 
Since Applicant has receipts and bank statements to show that all the daughter's expenses are paid for from her own pocket and that she has not withdrawn anything from the said account, these receipts and bank statements should be exhibited in the affidavit as evidence
Applicant should also reply to the email stating her position. If they do not want to cooperate, it will seem as if they are uncooperative and this can also be shown as evidences exhibited in the affidavit 
Applicant just has to show that she is reasonable in what she is seeking for and that it is in the best interest of the child. She is also just complying with the Court Order given and she is not asking for anything more "
"It's regarding his ex wife, from May 2018 onwards he stoppped paying maintenance fee because he can't afford the maintenance fee since he is jobless. He owes $14,000 to his ex-wife from then till now, a total of 12 months. The change in his monthly income since May 2018 till now is $1,000. ","It's recommended to go to family court and file a change in maintenance fee to lower down the sum, by showing how much his income has changed since May 2018. "
Applicant is divorced over 20 years. He have been paying for maintenance to Son. His son is 26 years old (born in 1993) and he do not know what the son is working as.,"Son has already crossed adulthood (above 21 years old). He can assume that the Son is able to take care of himself. 

The Mother will then be the one stating that Applicant had made a breach of order if she feel that the maintenance should not stop. But Applicant can bring up the point that the Son is above 21 years old.

This is the most ideal right now: Applicant can stop paying the maintenance and see what actions will the Mother take (by way of enforcement). Applicant might need to file for an affidavit later on if the Mother respond.  

There is no time limit for the maintenance, or the enforcement by the Mother. However, the Applicant can vary the order to ""no maintenance to the Son"" if he would like to protect himself but it would cost him money. "

"
Client's divorced is recently finalised. Client's ex-husband is not cooperative. He refuses to pay the client child maintenance and cooperate with the transfer of the house to the client. Client's ex-husband has locked her out of the house. HDB said they would write to the Syariah Court on her behalf. ,"Client needs to invoke the clause to get the Syariah Court registrar to sign. The clause in question is that the client has to give the other party 14 days written notice to sign the transfer documents. If the other party doesn't do so, she can get the Registrar of the Syariah Court to sign. 

If the HDB Legal Department told her that their legal department would do it for her, she would have to wait for the legal department to do it for her. 

She needs to get the Registrar to sign the transfer. Alternatively, she needs to prepare an affidavit which she can download from the Syariah Court website. She can attach evidence that she has given the husband 14 says notice to sign the HDB transfer paper but he did not comply. She needs to present to the papers to the Registrar and the Registrar needs to sign the papers. She needs to take the transfer papers and the letters from HDB to her ex-husband asking him to sign the papers. 

It might be faster for her to go to the Syariah Court to effect the transfer herself. She may want to confirm with HDB that HDB will present the transfer documents to the Syariah Court and get the transfer documents signed. If HDB is not going to do so, then it will be better to do it herself. 

The Court Order is clear. She needs to give the husband 14 days written notice to comply with the transfer/sign the transfer documents before the Registrar allows the transfer. 

Referred her to the Syariah Court website and gave the client the link to the form. 

She can claim the arrears. Mediation is a normal process and procedure. During the mediation, the mediator will try to work out how will he pay the client. The husband needs to show why he is unable to pay. He may take out an application to vary the order or to reduce the maintenance for the children. 

From the date the order was made, she is not entitled to the maintenance for herself. The maintenance for the children will not be changed. For any maintenance paid to her after the date, the other party may claim the money back. Or he can used it to offset the arrears owed. 

If he doesn't comply with the court order, the court may sentence him to jail, but he still has to pay the maintenance. "
"Applicant could not pay for the amount of maintenance. 

The divorce was completed by a private lawyer (engaged by both parties). ","Lawyer mentioned that they need to file a document. 

The lawyer suggested that she can start accepting the lower order maintenance fee before the order is varied. 

They can write down in their own words first and it should be acknowledged by both parties. 

Asking the lawyer that they have already engaged to work on the varied order would be a faster option. "

"The client was previously divorced and has filed a summons to enforce a maintenance order for herself and 2 children. 
On the 4th of march, there was a summons filed against the client where he has applied for the access to the children to be increased while the maintenance will be reduced and the maintenance of the child to be eliminated completely.

The grounds for this is that the father has low income and assumed that the child has part time work and is financially independent.","The client should file an affidavits to contest against the summons and contest against the grounds.

The client must discredit the father and persuade the court against the summons. 

The client is also persuaded to get a lawyer to represent them in court if she does not wish to face the father.

The father's earning capacity will be the deciding factor on whether the court will be persuaded to the client's side. 

With regards to access to the children, the client must be able to give reasons on why the father should not be given increased access to the children.  

There is no care and control on the older son as he is considered an adult."

Ex-husband did not fulfill the 2 previous court-orders - $1000 for child maintenance for 2 daughters ($500 each). He is currently legally represented while the applicant is not. 

Ex-husband used to work in a bank as an operations analyst. He was terminated from his job as he did not declare he had a court-order to pay maintenance for his children despite the bank requiring such declarations to be made. Claiming that there is a change in circumstances in income and wants to reduce child maintenance costs. 

Applicant's current bring-home income is $1,800 and is paying for her two children and her parents.

Ex-husband gave her a lump sump of $250,000 to purchase a house for the family previously. Applicant bought the house but did not inform him where their house is out of fear of debt collectors coming after her.  ","Advised the applicant to go to LAB and hopefully get legal representation.

She is able to self-represent but will require assistance with her reply affidavit. If she wants to represent herself, she can go to the Family Courts/ Crimson Logic to see a sample affidavit. 

Advised the applicant to reply to the affidavit and defend against his application. The termination of the ex-husband should not be self-induced. Right now, it could be argued that his termination was self-induced because he failed to reveal the truth. Cannot put the blame on the applicant who is supporting her children. 

She does not have to reveal her address if she puts to the court her reason, but she has to inform the court of her purchase of the flat. 

Can ask court for an adjournment of the case if she is unable to get legal representation in time. Let the court know she wishes to get legal representation first. 

For her child maintenance, she should continue to claim $500 per child - list out all the predicted expenses of her children.

The current case goes to future maintenance amounts. "
"Has a maintenance application for the hearing stage coming up soon. Intends to divorce her husband soon on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour now - domestic violence, abusive language and is disrupting her career plans intentionally by spamming her phone. Suffered multiple injuries to her body, eyes etc and has photographic evidence of these injuries. PPO currently pending now. 

Applicant is a Singaporean citizen, husband just became a PR. She used her CPF to get the matrimonial home and as of now, husband is not paying for the house and the applicant alone is paying $2000 in cash for the house now. Husband is blocking her from entering the home by changing the lock, despite them being joint owners and is currently renting out 3 rooms of the flat. Applicant is then staying with her parents now. 

Claiming for $1,500 for herself and her 2 year old child for maintenance in total; $800 to child and $700 to wife. Husband is working as a researcher at ASTAR, income is $4500. Applicant is working in a local commodity company with a monthly income of $3000. Husband is currently offering $500 in total now for wife and child maintenance, which is too low for the applicant given her financial burdens.

","Bring supporting documents for the hearing stage.

Report to the police that her husband has barred her from entering the flat by changing the lock. State that the police should break the lock and ask for assistance from the police when she wants to enter the flat. She has every right to enter the house. 

Has to explain to the court why she requires $700 for wife maintenance despite her $3000 income. Some things she could list would be the payment of the housing loan and other living expenses. For the child, she has to write the breakdown of the expenses expected. Informed her that the sum she will receive from the court may be different from what she is claiming for. Include maid expenses to the court too for the child maintenance. 

Can request for half the rental fees the husband is receiving from renting out the rooms in the flat. Requires proof of this rental situation. Since husband is refusing to pay her half the rental amount now, there is nothing much she can do since the Family Court will not look into this matter. She has to commence divorce first. She should check with the HDB branch office to see if its registered for a rental agreement. 

Advised applicant to not pay in cash for the house because it will be considered as joint contribution. Instead, she should pay by cheque and file the cheques properly because this would be considered payment by her and she can use this as evidence upon divorce. Upon divorce, can ask for sale of flat and ask for lump sum from the sale of the flat for child maintenance because he intends to go back to China to avoid these duties. 

Can let the court know that the husband's primary duty to towards her and her child. That would make payment to parents secondary obligation, which is now $1000 SGD that is too high.

Informed the applicant of how the maintenance order works - it will be a debt that he has to pay.

To proceed divorce on grounds of unreasonable behaviour. Can use PPO summons against him but right now it is still pending. Able to submit her medical reports to the court for divorce.   "
"Applicant has a 9 months old child. She has moved out of matrimonial home. Applicant's husband is being difficult with the separation ie not wanting to sign the separation deed. Applicant is only asking for $170 (and none for herself).

The applicant caring for the daughter. The husband locked her out the their HDB flat. Applicant has made a police report. 

Applicant had been advised by her former lawyers to file to pre-divorce maintenance.

The husband does not want a divorce and is controlling. ","By not even asking for $1 for her maintenance, she does not have the chance to vary the amount in the future.

The position that the applicant has taken makes it feel like she is a pushover and the husband is taking advantage of her.

Applicant should consider getting a new lawyer to renegotiate and enforce her full legal rights from afresh. However, the applicant could act for herself but she would be disadvantaged given that the husband has lawyers.

Since the husband is not agreeable to separation, the applicant has to wait for 4 years. The date of separation starts from the time she left the household.

Note that once the divorce process starts, there will be compulsory counselling. In her scenario, custody will likely be joint since the husband is not abusive. Care and control will be shared but will likely be in her favour. She will likely get maintenance. 

Notwithstanding the difficulty with engaging the lawyer, consider engaging a lawyer that is affordable -- eg one that allows payments in installments. 

Applicant cannot prevent the husband from seeing the child even though the husband has not paid.

Given that the applicant has not been persistent about maintenance, the Judge may see it as she has consented to not receiving.

Put on record via the police each time the Husband locks her out. This would be favourable for her during divorce. In addition, track things like any abusive text messages.

Despite not keeping receipts, the applicant can rely on her affidavits. But she should keep receipts moving forward. "
Applicant has been married for 2 years. She is pregnant for 7 months and the husband is not supporting her. The husband has assisted loansharks but let off by the police conditionally. Applicant stood as his bailor. The husband produced applicant's medical records to unknown people to settle his loans.,"The applicant could report the matter to the police. Thereafter, the criminal matter is out of applicant's hands.

Even without divorce, applicant can obtain maintenance. Applicant needs to explain to the Judge the amount required for daily living.

If husband cannot pay, there is nothing that the applicant can do. However, as he is still driving Grab, it is still sensible for the applicant to obtain the court order first. It does not matter that the husband has debts to pay.

Consider hiring a lawyer if the applicant wants to get a court order for a ""pre-divorce maintenance"". "
Litigant has divorced with her ex husband and makes her pay 300 dollars every month. For school fees it used to be paid for by CDA but now it must be paid for by them. She needs to get additional maintenance for the child.,Go to the family court website and ask them for the variation form or fill the form online at the family justice court website.

Litigant has changed her account and needs to get maintenance as it was initially paid to a different account. Her husband's payment has been inconsistent.,Go to family court and apply for enforcement for the time that he did not pay because of the bank issue and also apply for the money to be transferred into her new account. Take note of how much money the husband needs to pay. Do it as soon as possible. Go to POSB and show the year and date her previous account was closed.

The client could not pay the lawyer back then and he claimed that as a result, the lawyer did not issue the final court order to him. $100,000 was then deducted from his CPF without the client's knowledge. The client then approached the lawyer but it is said that the lawyer has completely ignored all his inquires. On top of that, an enforcement order has been filed against the client for his failure to pay maintenance.","The client would then have to do a variation of the court order  (of which he is already in the midst of doing). It must be noted that this is independent of the enforcement order made against him. 

It may not be in the client's interest to sue the lawyer given that it is in itself costly by nature. It is suggested that the client settle with the lawyer out of court. Should she still avoid communication with the client, claiming against the lawyer may then be an option, should the client be financially able to. 

However, it must be known that it has been 4 years since the order was made. The client must adequately explain to the court why he had waited so long before choosing to vary the court order.

The lawyer has advised Applicant that her ex-partner might say that Applicant left her job to claim more money from him. Thus, Applicant needs to state why she had left her job. 

The lawyer has advised Applicant that she is sure to get variation but it depends on how much she can get. 

The lawyer has advised Applicant that her ex-partner may state that he does not have the means and capacity to pay as he is unemployed. "
"The client is currently undergoing a divorce and would like to inquire about the maintenance of his children and wife. The client would like to decrease the maintenance, while his wife would like to increase it. The wife has varied the court order three times, asking for an increase in maintenance. ","The client may make an application to vary the court order, stating his financial difficulties. Should the issue not be solved during mediation itself, it would go up to the judge. 

It is noted that the client must have a change of financial circumstances, i.e. a loss of job, etc, should he wish to contest the variation of the court order or to seek a variation of it on his behalf. The court will then weigh the various factors and make a decision. Should the client lose his job, maintenance may be temporarily deducted or paused, depending on the court. It is however, noted that the client must find a job as soon as that happens. 

Should the wife choose to vary the court order and seek an increase in maintenance, the client may also raise certain issues such as his medical expenses. 

Moreover, given that the client is currently unsure of the amount in which his wife is seeking for by variation of the order, it is important that the client finds out the aforementioned details in order to respond to it.  "

","She can return to the Family Court and file a summons that he did not pay the maintenance. She has to serve the summons on him overseas.. But she may have some problems  as the other party is overseas. If he doesn't come to Singapore, there is nothing she can do about it.

"Client obtained a divorce in 2013. As the client has some financial difficulties, he wants to reduce the maintenance. The monthly maintenance is $2,000. Client was working as a taxi driver, but he has since stopped driving due to some problems in his eye. He is now working part time. 

He has 3 children - one is in NS, one is in Polytechnic and one is in Secondary 1. His ex-wife is working. 

Client says he gives her a reduced amount, and the ex-wife has no issues with it. ","The order has been made for maintenance. He needs to explain go to court and explain why he is unable to pay for maintenance. 

He can go to the Family Justice Court to file a summons to vary the maintenance order. He needs to file an affidavit to state the reasons why he wants to reduce the maintenance. He needs to state the amount of maintenance he wants to have reduced to. 

After he has filed the summons in court, he needs to serve the summons and affidavit on his ex-wife.

As the wife is not making a fuss, he may not need to file to vary the maintenance at the moment. He may do so if the wife makes a noise about it.  "
"The client would like to request maintenance from the father of her illegitimate child. The client claims that the father does not want to claim any responsibility for the child. 

Given that the client was only 15 years old when she engaged in a sexual relationship, it is considered illegal and thus a police report was made. However, she claims that there has yet to be an update from the police. ","It is recommended that the client is to request a DNA test to establish that the alleged father of the child, is indeed the biological father. It is recommended that she makes her way down to the Family Court to request for maintenance.  

It is also suggested that the client is to check the status of the police investigation. "
"The client has filed from a maintenance order for herself against her husband. The Family Court, however, has referred her here as it is not within their jurisdiction given that her husband is not a Singapore citizen. The divorce was filed in Singapore. 

The client has yet to file the memorandum of appearance in regards to the divorce. ","Given that the husband is currently overseas, there is no possible way that the court can enforce that maintenance will be paid to the client. The court may give her the order, but ultimately, enforcement remains a problem as the client's husband is overseas and thus not subjected to Singapore's jurisdiction. Thus, it may not be recommended that she get a lawyer to file for a maintenance order. 

It is still recommended that the client is to go through with the divorce first. "
"Applicant was divorced in February 2018. Maintenance he was ordered to pay is at $1500 for 3 children aged 15, 13 and 11. 

Applicant is earning 20% lesser than what he used to. He would be at most be able to pay $1000. 

Children are not coming to him during his access time. They are not keen to meet him. She blocked him and did not let the kids see him during the designated times.

Applicant just went to court today as his ex-wife took an order against him for arrears.","To lower that maintenance, application would have to take out a summons for a downward variation of the order.

For the court to entertain his application, he would have to show a change of material circumstances from the date of the order they gave and now. 

As for his access time, applicant can apply to the courts for the enforcement of the access order."
"Applicant is getting $350/month for 2 children and 50% of all school related expenses. This order was made in July 2014. 

He took out an application for a variation of maintenance order. He wants it to be lowered to $500/kid. He now has to support his stepchildren and he is also earning less. 

Applicant is also earning more now because she continually improved herself these years. ","Ultimately, the court would do a comparison between the applicant and her ex-husband.

The court would also take into consideration all matters at hand. His first priority should be his own children and not his stepchild. The fact that he remarried and has to take care of a stepchild is not a material change in circumstance. 

He could possibly show that he is earning less than the applicant but his pay has still increased over the years. 

She would have to craft her affidavit to show that she still needs the maintenance money. "
"During Mar2018, applicant's wife treated a case as family violence and she moved out to shelter. In May2018, he received a maintenance order and applicant went to Family Court for the accusations and charges. He then agreed for an amount of 1000 dollars per month. Since May2018, he is unable to transfer the full amount because he was unemployed and also paid directly to family (and not through the court order). 

In July2018, applicant received notice to attend court for the maintenance order. He was prepared to engage a lawyer to challenge the accusations (wife was applying for pbo, wanted to dispute the maintenance amount and the order itself). He had all the necessary evidence with him. Upon mediation, his wife agreed to drop the enforcement of maintenance order in front of the judge. She agreed not to pursue the case further. After case was discharged, he moved the wife and kid from the shelter and things are ok. Wife found a full time job in Nov18 while he has not found one. However, he is paying for the rental fee of where they stayed. During occasional disputes, wife will bring out the maintenance order as a threat.",He has to go to the court to rescind the maintenance order (since the wife has only agreed not to enforce the maintenance order but it is unclear whether the maintenance order has been cancelled). He has to confirm with the court whether it is for future payments and arrears or just arrears or else the wife would just keep on threatening him. 
"His son is 20 years old. His son is still doing medical studies now. The current maintenance he is paying for his son is $450. His ex-wife prevented their son from speaking to Applicant since young. As Applicant is currently unemployed, his son's school fees are paid by Applicant's mother. Applicant's PR status is expiring in Sep 2019 and he intends to return to his home country.","He can only stop paying maintenance for his son when his son gets his first degree and starts working. National Service does not count as a salary job, only as an allowance, unless his son goes back as a medical officer. If he discontinues with maintenance, his ex-wife can bring him to Court to demand for maintenance. 
If Applicant has no idea on his son's employment status, he can continue paying for about 7 years then stop and see what happens. 
Even without a salary, Applicant has to continue paying maintenance. However, he can apply for variation of order.
CPF is a separate issue from maintenance.
If Applicant were to return to his country and he stops paying maintenance, his ex-wife would not be able to serve Writ of Summons on him if they are unsure of his whereabouts (address is necessary). 
His request to stop paying maintenance to his son has to be approved by his ex-wife, not the son.
If request for maintenance was sent to Applicant's mother instead, she can refuse to pay as the issue is with Applicant. Applicant can also write in to his son to ask to stop his maintenance when he turns 21 years old."
Applicant finding way to reduce maintenance for children from 700 dollars. Applicant has started a new family with 3 young kids (1 more kid from ex wife). Applicant lost job 2 months ago and has financial difficulty in paying maintenance. ,"Possibly explain to ex-wife about his circumstances and whether she is willing to concede, or try to get his daughter to talk to his ex wife. 
Alternatively, apply to court to vary maintenance order. Court will assess his dire change in circumstances but they would not order 0 dollars as maintenance fee. At least, 1 dollar to secure principle that applicant is obliged to pay. "
"Applicant is asking maintenance from divorce. Once the children reaches 21,have to ask father for continued maintenance. Father just cut of 1000 off maintenance when the sons went to NS. Applicant went to Family Court and they asked him to repay her. Presently, the kids are already 21 so have to decide on course of action they have to take. ","Once children are 21 and are still studying, they have legal basis to ask for maintenance. They have to personally file for maintenance or consult a lawyer (but only when he stops paying maintenance then the kids should take out the maintenance application since the form didn't say that husband should pay until 21) "
"Separated from wife and child of 5 months old. Applicant's wife is determined to get a divorce as she is not happy in the marriage. Applicant is concerned about maintenance issues following a divorce.

A hearing has been set on the 17th January at the Family Courts.","Maintenance is only for the Applicant's wife and child and does not include the cost of the maid.

Applicant is advised to attend the hearing and to express his unhappiness at the hearing itself in front of the judge/mediator to discuss the maintenance costs fairly. The sum would be determined by the courts considering their lifestyles. 

"
Her parents went through a divorce and father is taking up a maintenance application against mother on the grounds of a change of the father's employment from a mechanic to a security guard. Father is supposed to pay the mother 500 dollars but is appealing against it as he would not be able to afford it following the change in his job. The mother is currently unemployed and in need of maintenance for her upcoming eye surgery. The mother is unable to be present as she is currently overseas taking care of her unwell sister.,"The mother would have to file her own affidavit that she would need the money for her eye operation for the Pre-Trial Conference as it gives the mother the right to reply based on the father's affidavit and application. This would include things such as her pay slip, income tax report, IRAA and CPF documents.

Firstly, client should check if her mother would like to apply for a lawyer of which should she want to, the lawyer would be able to handle the case on her behalf. 

Secondly, the mother must email the husband's lawyer regarding her inability to attend the hearing. The client is suggested to attend court on the mother's behalf and explain to the judge. The mother must be sure of her stand as to whether she wants to fight the case or not. From there, should she want to fight the case, the client can appeal to the judge for more time to find a lawyer. 

Thirdly, regarding financial aid, as the mother must be around during the consultation and application with Legal Aid, she could opt for next best alternative, the Basic Legal Services, to help the mother in the drafting of documents, under the mother's name. 

It is strongly suggested that the mother should at least fly back for the pre-trial conference so that she could explain her situation in detail to the judge and make her stand regarding the case.  For Legal Aid, it may take a few months in itself and her mother must apply as soon as possible as she may not be able to apply in time. "
"Children Maintenance Issue:

21 year old and 18 year old children.
Applicant has been paying maintenance - $3,000 per month per child, amounting to total quantum of $6,000.

Consent order: Does applicant have to pay for son that has reached the age of 21. He has completed his National Service and is going for his studies.

Under clause in consent order, education expenses have to be paid for Son, when order was made in 2013, it is not specified whether ""education"" covers university education going forward.

Applicant is worried that if both son and daughter pursue university education overseas, he will be unable to afford. ","Legal issue #1:
Even for males that turn 21, maintenance fees have to be continued to be paid by Applicant.

Legal issue #2:
Take up an Originating Summons to discern whether the Applicant has to pay for University fees.

No material difference for payment towards university fees, be it for overseas university or local university. only difference is quantum of fees given subsidies for local universities."
Applicant is divorced and has sole custody over their son. Her son has special needs therefore the expenditure of her son is $3000 per month. ,"Lawyer advised that applicant needs to have an application to vary the child maintenance - to increase the maintenance.

Applicant will have to explain the reasons for the increase in maintenance. Applicant can also provide evidence of her ex-spouse increase of salary as he was formally an intern and now a full time staff.
 
Applicant to provide her own finances and how the varied maintenance. 

Applicant can go back to family court to enquire about paralegal to assist in her application to increase. 

Applicant can ask for expenses for her son with her ex-spouse. For example, the car - cost of petrol. if the ex-husband challenges the increase of the maintenance then he will have to disclose his salary."
"Applicant is divorced from her ex-husband and the ex-husband wants to provide a maintenance of $200.

Applicant's ex-husband claimed that he cannot pay for the $1000 maintenance. ","Lawyer told applicant to explain why the maintenance cannot be adjusted from $1000 to $200. 

 Lawyer told applicant that she can request to the court for the extension of submission of documents."
"Applicant is divorced and has 2 sons. Both of the sons are above 21. However, one of the son is still doing NS. Child maintanence order of $2000 was given 2002.","Lawyer advised applicant to go to family court to take out an application to varied the maintenance of order and cancel maintenance for 2 sons but only for the daugther. 

Lawyer advised that applicant can seek private lawyer to settle the child maintenance."
"2014 the applicant was involved with a girl, was a court order to pay maintenance to a child. The child is seven or eight now. The applicant has been paying to that person since then. Lost job, has a period of 3 months to stay in Singapore. As he cannot stay in Singapore, he cannot continue paying maintenance. ","There is nothing that can be done about staying in Singapore. What can be done is to engage a Singapore lawyer while still here, or to engage an overseas lawyer when the applicant has returned to his country. Depends on what application the girl files. Currently there is nothing. Can't comply with the court order because he does not have a salary. May not be able to stay too long, things beyond his control. More of a personal dispute. The child is illegitimate as born out of wedlock."
"Ex-husband has not paid Maintenance, and he is not in Singapore. Ever since the 2nd child was born in 2008, he has not been in Singapore. He has since passed away in overseas.

Joint-Tenancy - by right the rule of survivorship would already apply.","File a notice to CrimsonLogic, that she is acting in person, and that her lawyer (during the divorce case) is no longer acting for her.
- ""Notice to act in person""

Produce evidence of his death - e.g. CPF letter with ex-husband's death date, pictures at the funeral wake, copies of obituaries, etc.
- Best Evidence rule: The best evidence rule is a legal principle that holds an original copy of a document as superior evidence. The rule specifies that secondary evidence, such as a copy or facsimile, will be not admissible if an original document exists and can be obtained."
"Applicant has a Maintenance application Mediation session next week (1st application), and wants to check if her documents are sufficient.

Applicant is applying for $2,000 a month, and has provided a breakdown of the amount. While the $2,000 per month is a lot, Applicant explained that she has been undergoing hypnotherapy, since she had undergone a very abusive relationship; and this price is the market rate.

Applicant used to be working in her ex-husband's company, until her employment got terminated after their separation. Now, she is living with her parents, and they support her.

Applicant also queried regarding her ex-husband's declared salary to the Court - $3,700, even though she ""knows for a fact"" that it is at least $5,600 a month.","Applicant's procedure is a MSS, not a Summons. Therefore, it is much more informal, and she would not even require an affidavit.

Applicant would be likely to struggle to get maintenance for the hypnotherapy, as it might not be seen as essential. Or at most it would be difficult for her to get the full amount from her ex-husband, as she is not working.

Courts would award based on the lifestyle to which the Applicant is accustomed. She should include all her typical expenses, e.g. groceries, transport.

Furthermore, typically, Court would typically not award 100%, if the Applicant does not work. Things which are seen as ""not so necessary"" may be knocked out.

Applicant should also bear in mind that while she may allege the salary thing to the Court, her ex-husband was dabbling in a family-run business, i.e. it would go up and down. While he might have been earning $5,600 per month back then, it might not be the case now. The $5,600 was not a fixed employee salary. Furthermore, if her ex-husband brings out his tax returns and shows the $3,700 amount, but Applicant disputes it, there is a likelihood that it could be serious - as it could amount to an accusation that her ex-husband was ""evading"" taxes, etc."
"Applicant and husband got divorced 2001 (unreasonable behaviour); not finalized until 2003. From 2003 to 2015, ex-husband did not pay her anything ($500 per month). In 2015, Applicant sought an enforcement, but he could backpay for only 3 years.

Applicant's ex-husband sold the family condominium, got $600,000. However, he did not pay the Applicant. Applicant wants to get money for this.

Furthermore, Applicant did not make the claims for maintenance during the 12 years, because she had thought that her ex-husband was in a bad shape, and she tried to be understanding. However, in 2014, she found out that he had sold the family condominium in 2008, and so she felt cheated and feels that she should have claimed the money at the time.

Also, Applicant's ex-husband has allegedly gotten into a long-distance relationship with a woman from overseas, and even told the Applicant via sms that he had gotten a new car.","Lawyer echoes the judge's words - that it would be very difficult for Applicant to claim back more than the 3 years' worth that she had already gotten.
- However, he added that nothing is to stop Applicant from making the claim at the Family Justice Courts.
- File an application at the Family Justice Courts for upward variation."
"Applicant's ex-wife was trying to enforce maintenance that applicant could not pay. Applicant is not represented. 

Applicant has accumulated some debt and also owes his wife about $8300. Applicant's ex-wife's lawyer made the maintenance order.

Applicant has to pay his ex-wife $2500 a month. 

Applicant and his ex-wife had planned to reconcile when the order was made. Applicant had taken out loans however his financial situation is the same. ","1. Applicant has to take a application to vary the maintenance order by way of summons and affidavit. However, to vary, he must have had a material change in circumstance. 

2. For applicant to self-represent, he has to draft his own affidavit and do his own filings. It would be preferable if the applicant is represented by a lawyer. 

3. Variation can come up to $4000-5000 excluding disbursements. "
"Applicant is concerned about previous judgements and is seeking further explanation. 

Applicant's wife is Muslim and he had converted to Islam himself. He has since divorced two years ago and has legally renounced his religion.

The first judgement is regarding an enforcement order that he owes her muta'ah of $11,100, substracting the $3200 his ex-wife owes to him. He will do so by depositing $100 to her account every month.

His wife must pay $240 a month as maintenance for his two children until they reach the age of 21. She will also reimburse $800 a share of their children's medical expenses up to May 2018.

She has not paid him for a few months.","Applicant mostly wanted clarification about the judgements.

If she fails to pay, he can bring up the case in court. "
"Separated for 2.5 years. Applied for divorce in 1998 overseas but it didn't go through. Reconciled in 2003, left him in June 2016. Husband is overseas, tried to reach out to her and reconcile during 2 years apart but she didn't pick up because she didn't believe he could change and didn't want to put herself through it again.

Daughter is 22 years old. Own a HDB in both names, own a semi-duplex house in overseas under both of their names. 

Wants to sell HDB in Singapore.","Go directly for divorce, can bypass deed of separation. 

HDB will not change name under house unless there is a divorce document.

Even if husband gives her power of attorney, he can still demand his half of proceeds of sale. Husband could just gift his ownership to her by going to HDB for transfer. HDB will accept case by case if she can hold the HDB as a single PR. 

Should bring the overseas property into divorce proceedings because it is still a matrimonial asset. 

Better to file for divorce in Singapore even if husband is currently living in India. Simplified divorce should take 2-3 months. Cost depends on lawyers. 

Husband cannot claim maintenance from wife unless he has health issues. Cannot claim back all the Medishield and other payments that she has previously paid on his behalf. 

Must go to lawyer to draft document so that she doesn't need to come to court again if there is something wrong with document.

Should complete divorce before proceeding with sale of HDB.

Can take a PPO to stop his harassment. Can go to psychiatrist to show that she is stressed out from husband's harassment and bring that to court.

Even contested divorce is only 1-2 years in Singapore, won't drag for 5 years like in India."

everything was prepared by her lawyer then signed by both parties
according to ex husband, he didn't receive anything from his reserved share benefits upon retrenchment
maintenance is 1 month in arrears
","Was not stated that he has to update her on his job status
She can go to family court and go to a lawyer to get it enforced if she feels he is underpaying
Court will issue a summons so he will have to attend in court
Unless he can take a variation on the clause if he is unemployed or is paid less and is unable to pay 
She does not need him to tell her, the minute she feels he is not paying up, she can just go straight to family court to apply for a summons to enforce
The court cannot make him disclose it as it is not a civil case, cannot go into discovery 
She has to seek an order and convince the court of why she deserves a higher maintenance
so if she wants to claim for the shares, she has to engage a lawyer to enforce the order so she can find out if he has received RSU

The court order states that he is to pay for the children's education. 

His basic salary is $2,430.  ","If he wants to reduce his maintenance payment, he needs to show a material change in circumstances.

Normally, the maintenance would have to paid until the children are 21. However, if the children are schooling, as per the court order, he still needs to pay maintenance. If he fails to do so, the other party can take out an application on the basis he breached a court order.

Lawyer has no time to interview her and understand the full background to know what to put into her affidavit. As such the lawyer is unable to advise her on what to write in her affidavit.

The summons and affidavit are two separate documents. 

Filing an application means to put in a summons. 

Lawyer explained to the applicant that a summons is like a prayer - what she wants from the court.

Go back to court and make him pay the arrears. If she is not agreeable to the proposal, don't sign it. She could show the court that this is the proposal he had made. 

If for some reason he has no source of income, then there is no point squeezing money out of stone. 

She could bring up that if he cannot afford it, why is he driving a car. "
"Applicant attended the Family Court on 22 Nov and the court ordered that he needs to pay his ex-wife and his child maintenance by 30 Nov. But he has no savings to pay up by 30 Nov. 

He has a congenital problem with his eyes - double vision. The eye specialist declared he is permanently unfit to work. ","Once the court made an order, he has to comply with the order. 

Otherwise he has to appeal the order.

He has only 14 days to appeal against the decision. 

If he cannot pay, then the other party will commence enforcement or commence committal proceedings against him. He will be sent to jail if he cannot pay up. 

If he still needs Legal Aid, perhaps he would seek his MP to write a letter to Legal Aid. 

Submitting false documents to government is a serious offence and would be liable for a jail term. "
Applicant is facing some financial difficulties. He is unable to pay the maintenance fee to his ex-wife. He has defaulted on the maintenance. He was supposed to pay $500. He has only paid her $300 per month for the last 2 months. He has a new family and has a third child on the way. ,"He needs to show that he has a material change in circumstance in his life. He needs documentary proof. For example, he could highlight that he has a new child on the way. He could then apply for a variation of the maintenance order. 

It would be better for him to reduce the maintenance order then to say he would pay e.g. $200 each month for a year and then pay $500 a month later. 

If he is sure his ex-wife is working now, he could ask for a variation of the order since at the time the order was made, it was 10 years ago, and she was not working then. 

He could ask the judge at the next hearing which is on 23 Nov for more time to write the affidavit and provide the documentary evidence. "

As for maintenance of herself, the applicant was informed that this was not an issue unless the ex-husband ceased payments for the applicant's maintenance.

Applicant states that her eldest son has received the maintenance money directly from her ex-husband, but she has pretended not to know of this. Applicant has specifically requested that this should not be recorded, as she felt it would harm her case.","The applicant was advised that she should specify that her two eldest children are still pursuing their education, as that would make them still eligible for maintenance."
"Applicant is 21, and financially reliant on her parents. She has just finished university. Her father appears to have the intention of asking her to leave the house.

Applicant had found work, but was asked to further her education by her parents. ","Applicant was informed that her parent's legal obligation to maintain only extends till age 21. Furthermore, any obligation to fund her education might fail, as she has already graduated from university.

Applicant was also informed that a gift given by her parents could be returned. However, the expensive gifts might be difficult to obtain, given that they are in her parent's safe.

4) can only afford - this amount - comfortable to the client - court will suggest an amount 
5) no charge on the CPF monies "
"Client has a court order that mandates that her ex-husband pay a specific amount of money. 

There is a warrant of arrest for the ex-husband. However, he has not stepped back into Singapore since the warrant was issued. ","1) Advice is that when client appears in open court, that she clarify whether the closure of the file affects the validity of the warrant of arrest. "
"Client is supposed to get $7,000 from the sale of a HDB. If the HDB is not sold, there is nothing to be claimed. ","1) There is nothing to be claimed if the HDB is not sold. 
2) Ask the courts for notes of evidence. 
3) If the notes prove that the $7,000 was meant for maintenance, then she should try to get a variation order. "
"Client wants to appeal the court order for the division of property. Under the court order, the wife gets 48%, the client gets 26% and the children get the rest of the flat equally. He wants to challenge the court order. He says he has been paying for the flat and that the wife had not contributed anything to the flat throughout the marriage. He feels aggrieved that the wife has gotten a large share of the flat and wants to challenge that. 

Client claims that he has an impression that he has received a summons for divorce 2 years ago. But he did not attend court as he claims he did not pay attention to the letter, or unaware that the letter has legal implications, and did not attend the divorce proceedings. 

Client has also defaulted on his maintenance payment to his ex-wife. Client claims he is unable to contact his ex-wife. He does not have his ex-wife's contact number nor does he have her bank account number. Client's ex-wife has apparently filed a summons for him defaulting on the maintenance. ","He should seek legal representation. 

Client was advised that his situation would require him to appeal the court to set aside his order. 

His matter would be quite difficult as a final order has already been given. 

To set aside the order, the client needs to provide a legal basis. 

Client needs to provide evidence  of his payment for HDB and his contribution to the family. 

Client was advised that under Singapore law, the division of matrimonial property would take into consideration the indirect contributions of a party such as ""cooking"" and taking care of the household. 

With regards to the maintenance, he needs to pay his wife the monies owed, and the monies going forward to the wife's bank account. If he doesn't have his wife bank account, he should use his best efforts to ensure he makes payment into his wife account.  

If he cannot afford to pay, he needs to apply to court and explain his finances. If he doesn't know her bank account, he needs to ask her. "
Applicant wants to know about her maintenance even if her husband left for overseas,"Applicant was advised to hire an overseas Lawyer to serve the summons on A/P as our court cannot serve documents out of Singapore due to jurisdiction reasons.  Applicant is also unable to serve the summons on her own and would require a lawyer.

Applicant was also advised to hire a lawyer to make an application for substituted service. If  applicant is unable to afford legal counsel, she was asked to seek aid from the legal aid bureau. 

Applicant was also advised to hire her own private lawyer if she earns beyond the expected amount to qualify for legal aid."
Client's ex-husband is applying for a variation to the maintenance order. Client's husband is an undischarged bankrupt. ,"The client needs to organise the affidavit and put tabs on the attachment. 

Depends on the judge, the variation order may be backdated, but it is unlikely this situation will arise. 

They can write to the OA to check whether the ex-husband has been discharged from bankruptcy. 

They could state in the affidavit that while he is applying to reduce the maintenance, he is still living a life of luxury. Their claims need to be truthful and substantiated. 

If the judge accepts that the husband is jobless and has no money to pay, the client is still unable to obtain payment. "
"Ex husband is psychiatric patient. Up till now, only gave 1 year of child maintenance. Ex husband avoids applicant. ","Have to find a way to get ex husband out.

"Client's wife took their daughter and joint bank account, leaving only a note. This happened before the divorce. During the divorce, the client did not raise the issue that the monies has been taken away. He then signed a court order that stated each parties will get to keep whatever is written in the name. 

Whenever he wants to see his daughter, his ex-wife will not allow it, claiming that the daughter does not want to see the client. The client does not believe this because whenever he spends time with his daughter, he finds that his daughter is reluctant to go back home to her mother (client's ex-wife).","The lawyer advises that it might be difficult to get the money in the joint bank account. He should raise the fact that his ex-wife had taken away money. The client may file a police report. It should be noted that in the lawyer's opinion, it would be very difficult to get the money back because the money that had been taken away was taken away before the divorce. The court order states that both parties will get to keep whatever is written in their names. Client can ask the court to set aside the court order. He can do this by hiring a lawyer.

For maintenance of his daughter, he should not put money in his daughter's CDA account because this does not necessarily equate to maintenance of his child. Going forward, the client may go back to court to ask for the court to specify the timing that he can see his daughter. He should go back to the family court to do specify when exactly he can see his daughter."
"Applicant informed that after a fight, A/P her husband had left the house about a month ago, leaving her with only $500 as maintenance of her son.","Applicant advised to proceed to Family Court to seek for maintenance in the summons from her husband at his last known address. Applicant was advised to proceed to Family Court to put in her application for maintenance for both herself and her child.  

Applicant was informed that if she intends to proceed with divorce, she would need to engage a lawyer and for matrimonial matters, this would be decided as part of matrimonial assets.  

Applicant was assured with regard to the custody of her child. "
"Ordered to go to court. Client still studying, hasn't gone to NS. Client is not capable to paying maintenance now. Client is working part time now. Plaintiff wants $900 a month for maintenance of baby but there's no way client can pay that sum. Plaintiff's father pays for baby's expenses using Medi-fund. ","Go to hearing, tell judge how much he earns a month, show payslips, expenses. Reason out why he can't be expected to pay the maintenance wanted by the plaintiff. Make sure everything appears reasonable to the judge. Don't think a lawyer is necessary. "
"Client's husband was to pay for child maintenance for 4 years from the date of the  court order on 18 August 2014.

However, one of the children is 15 years old.

There is also another line which states that the ex-husband was to pay for the child's education expenses until secondary school. 

After the four years were up, the ex-husband has refused to pay maintenance after the time was up. She had only agreed to it then as the ex-husband promised to keep on paying the child maintenance after the four years will up. ","Client can go to Legal Aid Bureau and see if they would take up her case. If she doesn't qualify for Legal Aid, she can go to a private lawyer and ask for a free consultation. 

Client needs to make an application in the Family Court to vary the court order.

Client may ask for the court to order the client's husband to continue paying child maintenance of $8000 for the one of the children who is currently 15 years old until the son turns 21 and ceases full time education. She could state that she did not have a lawyer then and did not understand what she was signing. "
"Would like to appeal against maintenance order. The original order was for $8,800 a month. Client has care and control of both daughters. The $8,800 covers maintenance for daughters. Due to an increase in tuition costs for her daughter, the client appealed for an increase in maintenance to cover this cost. 

The court at first hearing for the variation of maintenance, gave an increase in maintenance for 6 months. The reason why only 6 months increase is because the client was not working. However, she was unable to work because of the nature of her visa and also because she is a full time mother who is taking care of her daughter who has depression. 

","Go to CrimsonLogic (19th floor) to help file the appeal. 

For the appeal, family justice courts practice directions will be instructive. "
Maintenance order.  Husband in Myanmar with new family. Warrant issued in 2014. Warrant set to expire soon. But Applicant has caught wind from friends that husband might come to Singapore next month.,"Inform the court that Applicant has news of ex husband coming back to Singapore, so as for the court to issue a new warrant. Produce evidence if any, of the ex husband's return. e.g. SMS from friends and relatives. Further, consider going to Legal Aid Bureau for further assistance."
Client's husband hasn't been paying the client maintenance since 2016. Client's husband is now uncontactable. ,Go to the family court and ask for the maintenance enforcement form. 
"Client had filed her divorce overseas. She has gotten a final order from her divorce overseas. She is now a Singapore citizen. According to the court order, she has custody of her children 2 and 4. The husband is supposed to pay maintenance of $500 every month to her kids with an increase for 10% every year. but the husband has defaulted on his payments. The kids are now overseas. They will come down to Singapore to start schooling. 

Her ex-husband sponsored her ex-husband for his Singapore PR status. She wants to terminate his PR status. He is currently working in Singapore. 

Before divorce, there were incidents where the ex-husband used violence against the client. Client alleges that there were some threatening messages from 2017.  Client stated that her ex-husband has not threatened to harm the children. ","Client can avoid her ex-husband and don't inform him of her whereabouts. In law, the is no cause of action as the violence happened some time ago. 

Family Court in Singapore doesn't recognise the divorce order issued by the overseas court
Client can register the judgment in Singapore as a Singapore judgment, and then she can enforce it in the family court of Singapore and claim maintenance from ex-husband,

Client can take up a fresh application for maintenance and introduce the divorce order as evidence.  

Client could try seeking help from Legal Aid or get a private lawyer to help her register the judgment. "
"The client has received an affidavit from her ex-husband and the court hearing occurred yesterday and the outcome was mediation. The previous lawyer was too expensive which she cannot afford. Reduction of maintenance of both children from $5,500 to $2,500. The kids have been dropped from the international school to local school. The $5,500 were not covering the school fees as she had paid for the additional fees by herself.  ",Talk to the lawyers to find the best quote with the best quality. Come up with a table to show the total expenses of the children. Re-check with the previous lawyer for the outcome. 
"Client has been divorced for a few years. Ex-husband has been more or less giving the alimony on time. The ex-husband transferred $5000 to her and then for the next few months, he transferred an extra amount every month. Following which, he stopped transferring money (he has not transferred for 3 months). 

The question is whether or not the random $5000 that he transferred can be considered to be part of the alimony amount. ","Recommendation is for the client to communicate with the ex-husband to see what the $5000 was for. 

Even if the ex-husband does not reply, having this in black and white will help as evidence. 

Action should only be taken once the excess amount runs out. "
"The client wishes to enforce the maintenance order she got from her divorce. Her ex-husband did not pay maintenance. He gave up his permanent residence, left the country and started travelling. The husband cannot be found. The court informed her that they wish to strike the case off the register, which she wants to avoid. 

She and her husband share joint custody of the children. She may have to pull her children out of the school as her husband did not pay his half of the school fees. She requires a letter from her husband to show the school. ","It may be difficult to enforce the maintenance order as the ex-husband cannot be found. She was advised to write a letter to court asking to vary the maintenance order so that instead of having joint custody, she would have sole custody. 

One of the documents that she should file could be an affidavit stating why the joint custody requirement should be varied and sole custody given to her. She could show the many steps that she took to try and trace him to the court, inform them that her husband knew that she is unable to contact him, in support for her application for sole custody.  "
"She had a hearing yesterday against her husband for divorce proceedings. Before the trial ended, the judge asked for applicant's bank account. The judge then told her that the case was dismissed. Her husband has two lawyers. She gave her husband cash gifts worth $10,000 and the husband gave her cash gifts worth $20,000. MOM told her that they got from HR that applicant did not send it in. Her husband said that she told her that she called HR to cancel the maintenance and that it is a private matter. She asked for a fair amount of maintenance. She wrote in to court to reopen the case so that she can submit new evidence. She plans to file an MOA out of time. She filed for maintenance before the husband filed for divorce. They signed a pre-nuptial agreement that the husband will provide her a lump sum of maintenance. However, as he travels a lot, he did not uphold his agreement. She then waived her claim on maintenance. For now, her mom has been sending her money. She has chat records of her saying that she does not like how her husband bites or squeezes her arm very hard since 2015. They are now separated since 2017. She wants him to go to trial.","She needs to draft her charge. She needs to take up a private complain.
She will first have to wait for the reply from court. Then if she is unhappy, she may want to appeal and do her own research. 
She should focus on the divorce proceedings and try to consult a lawyer and negotiate the lawyer fees. "
He send a registered post to the other party but the court told him to do personal service.,"It must be personally send, no one else but the other party.

"Client and his wife have divorced. They have two kids. Client claims he did not receive the final judgment as he did not attend court. The judgment states that he needs to give the matrimonial home to his ex-wife. He has to pay child maintenance of $500 per child. Client claims he was unaware of the ancillary matters proceedings as he did not receive any letter with regards to the proceedings. 

He was issued a summons for failing to pay the maintenance fee. A consent order has been made to pay the arrears in maintenance. 

His wife has also applied to ask for more maintenance. 

He went to Legal Aid but they rejected his case. 

Client had been a bankrupt. He has two sickly parents to look after. ","Tell the judge of his situation. He can appeal against the consent order, but it is difficult. He has to explain on his affidavit with regards to his situation. 

He can make an application to vary the consent order with regards to the maintenance but there must be a material change in circumstances from the date the order was made. The chances of success are very low. He can appeal to the court's sense of justice that his ex-wife is earning more than him. 

Not having access to the mailbox is not an excuse or not receiving the letters from his ex-wife is not a valid excuse for not participating in the proceedings. He should have been proactive in managing his case during the ancillary proceedings. 

His Legal Aid application to set aside the judgment failed on the merits. He could go to Legal Aid to ask them to help him to try to vary the maintenance order.

Matrimonial assets and maintenance. 2 children, aged 5 and 6.

Mutually agreed (consent order) that there would not be maintenance for children, and flat to be divided 50-50. Also waived maintenance for herself.

To settle the divorce quickly, she agreed to his terms. Unlikely to get her maintenance as he is likely to return to overseas and give up his PR status.

Now seeks to vary court order to include maintenance.","To claim maintenance for the 2 children, it is an uphill task.

Take out application in court by way of summons to claim maintenance for the 2 children, but he will claim that she previously agreed to maintain them on her own.
- Once you have agreed to maintain on her own, entitlement to variation requires her to show a change in circumstances.
- At the time she agreed, what was her financial position, and what her financial position is now. Then show why she can no longer maintain the children. 
- Maintenance is not a final order.

If he refuses to pay maintenance and is not in Singapore, register the court order in the overseas court and enforce it there.

Possible to represent herself, but must prepare summons and affidavit.
- Can represent herself first, then engage the lawyer at a later stage.

If parties are agreeable, can have another consent order varying the existing consent order.

Division of flat cannot be changed as it is a final order, but can be varied by agreement"
"Trouble with ex-husband. Divorced for unreasonable behaviour.

Owes a debt of $58,000 to her, and about $100,000 to others.

Court order requires him to pay not less than $1,200 per month. Paid $1,200 once in November 2017, and another $300 in July 2018.

He works as a service engineer, earning $3,000+. Not yet remarried, and unclear where he lives.

Matrimonial home transferred to her.

Amount incurred due to unauthorised withdrawal using her credit card. Repayment plan developed for her to repay $1,200 per month.

Working as an executive, earning $5,000+, care and control with her. Husband refuses to pay maintenance, and she has to file a complaint with Family Court.","Not a criminal matter, Need to know where he lives in order to issue the summons.

As she does not know where he lives, proceed to enforce maintenance for $500+ per month first, so that she can find out where he lives. Force him to come to Family Court to explain why he refused to pay the sums.
- Attach maintenance to his earnings.
- even if he is a bankrupt, he has to pay maintenance. If he wants to reduce maintenance, he has to make a court application.

To reclaim the $58,000,
First, give him a notice to comply with the court order.
If it fails, engage a lawyer to take out a civil case against him. 
- Need to engage a lawyer to sue him for the recovery of the sum less any amounts he has paid.
- If he fails to pay, this debt is considered matrimonial assets and cannot be pursued in Family Court. Must be claimed in a civil suit. To recover this money, commence action against him in a civil court.
- even if commence civil action, he can still default payment regardless of the judgment. Can try to garnish his salary, but unlikely to retrieve the sums.

Alternatively, commence bankruptcy proceedings against him by issuing a statutory demand. As the debt is below $100,000, he will be put on the debt repayment scheme, and Official Assignee will require him to pay a certain sum.
- Other debts may be enough to make him a bankrupt.

Alternatively, can try to frame it as a maintenance claim, but highly unlikely.

For now, repay the banks, if not they will claim against her.
- Work out a debt restructuring. Negotiate with the banks.

Police will not help as this is a matrimonial matter. Police will only take action if there is violence.

May not be worth commencing civil action, but file the maintenance summons. "
"Son has been in a relationship with a girl for 2 years and confessed that he made the girl pregnant. Son is 20 and girl is 19. Two families met together to attempt to resolve the issue. 

Have receipts to pay for medical expenses in March. Over time, girl's family started to become more demanding. 

Delivery of baby was in June. Heard that the delivery was in Hospital and offered $500 and gold chain to the family.  

Father of the girl started demanding for payment for maintenance of $1,300/month and threatened to go to Family Court to claim. Son is currently a student and working part-time, earning $300/month. 

Son and girl were already going for marriage preparation course but did not complete it as other family continuously claimed for money and applicant doesn't wish to pay. Other family does not want anything to do with the son and trying to separate the couple. 

There is no proof that the child is the son's child. 

On 6 September, there is a mediation between the parties. ","May have to give money for maintenance. Request for list of expenses from the other family as evidence. If there are no receipts, payment will depend on the facts. Also ask for the bill for the delivery of the baby which the family is claiming to be $10,000. 

As son is not 21, he is considered minor, court may look towards the parents to pay for the maintenance. Will look at how much the parents are earning. Should raise that the son is a student and may not have the means to pay for maintenance. Applicant could show the court his own income and expenses and his inability to be able to pay a high amount for maintenance. Technically after the son turns 21, the other family can go after the son for maintenance. 

Prepare the documents for the mediation as stated in the letter. However, don't show the documents and don't offer to pay first and see what the mediator says. If son is unable to pay a satisfactory amount to the other side, it is likely that the other parties may bring them to court. 

A possible outcome is that the other parties may be able to claim for the mother's medical expenses during pregnancy and also for the medical expenses for the baby. 

Can suggest for a subsequent mediation where both parties can each bring their own documents. 

If the other party is claiming that the son is the child's father, request for the son's name to be included in the birth certificate as the father. "
"Uncontested divorce, she has care and control and the father has the access. Based on the current court order, he has access 3 days a week and how much he is to pay: $1200 monthly for child maintenance and she does not have maintenance.

(1) Read the statements in the affidavit. 
(2) Don't need to use legal language in her reply. Respond to each paragraph that is consequential. If you don't challenge anything, then it is presumed that she admits it. 

Think like a mother. Multiple WhatsApp messages in one page will save her money.

The evidence that she wants to use during cross examination should be submitted first so that he won't be able to object. 

Kid maintenance:
Child maintenance for $1200, does it include $500 he pays while he is with the child. Include these terms during the contesting. The law is silent on this. 

Honestly, court order is just a piece of paper. It is only as strong as how much parties abide to the terms of it. State possible future needs of the child. "
Applicant met with a Legal Aid lawyer on the 27th August regarding an extension for filing the documents. Applicant wrote into the Family Courts via e-mail and they responded that they cannot extend the process. Applicant has no representation.,Applicant has to apply to the court for extension of time.

Applicant claiming for child maintenance for her 5 year old until child is 21. Both she and her ex-spouse have come to an agreement that she will claim a lump sum, but they were told that the courts cannot order the transfer to be done by CPF under the label of ""maintenance"". However, Applicant and her ex-spouse still wish to explore the option of transferring an amount by CPF, but need a supporting document. 
Applicant and her ex-spouse have a current agreement that she will no longer require an official maintenance sum ordered by the courts, as her ex-spouse is already going to transfer the title of their house to her. Privately, the two of them will still initiate a funds transfer from him to her.

"The applicant has divorced in 2009 under Sharia Law. The applicant gave the matrimonial home to his wife. Also, he agreed to give his wife $83000 as maintenance. There was a private verbal agreement between the applicant and his wife that she will not enforce the payment of the money since she already got the entire house. The wife took the entire house. Now, the wife wants to enforce payment of the $83000. The applicant felt cheated by the wife as he is now facing financial problems and sickness. ","The applicant could mention to the judge that due to his unforeseen changes in circumstances ie diabetes and his drop in income, he is unable to pay his wife the maintenance and $83000."
"Applicant's maintenance fee is $1,000, which is insufficient for her daily expenses. She had already asked to increase the maintenance fees once. Her next hearing is 28 August 2018. Her husband is unwilling to increase her maintenance fees again. She asks what are the chances of the judge allowing the increase of maintenance fees, and what she could do to help our case. 

She is also unwilling to divorce, and asks the appropriate steps if her husband files an application to court for divorce. 

She asks if the divorce is granted, would she be able to get some of her husband's assets. ","The judge will ask why she is seeking to increase her maintenance fee twice. She will need to explain the reason - for example, it is insufficient for her monthly expenses, and the fact that her husband is a director who has a lot of cash. It would be better if she can show evidence of her monthly expenses to show that the current $1,000 is not enough. 

There are two stages to divorce: judge will look at the behaviour of the parties before deciding whether to grant the divorce, and the negotiations of maintenance fee. The applicant's husband may file an application to court for divorce, and it is for the applicant to show why her behaviour was reasonable so as for the judge to grant the divorce.

If the judge grants a divorce, the husband's assets in the company that he is director in will have to be disclosed, and she would be able to get a part of the husband's assets. Regarding her house, the courts will take into account her non-monetary contributions to the house to determine what proportion of the house to grant to the applicant. "
"Applicant is divorced. Her ex-husband is seeking to reduce the maintenance fee to her from $2,500 to $1,000. She has to go to court on 28 August 2018. She would like to seek advice as to whether she can represent herself and the appropriate procedure.  Applicant's ex-husband is earning $10,000 per month. ","Applicant may not understand legal terms, and it is to ex-applicant's disadvantage that her husband has a lawyer to represent him. She can draft an affidavit stating the reasons why she should keep the present maintenance fees, pointing to the fact that she has physical disabilities and only has a part-time job. In addition, she can adduce evidence to substantiate her claim, for example her payslip and her medical records. 

A commissioner has to sign off on the affidavit. The applicant can go to any law firm or Family Court to ask if they have commissioners to assist in the signing off. 

On the date of the hearing, she may request for adjournment if she is unable to get a lawyer or complete the affidavit. She may also ask for adjournment if she is unable to get her medical report in time. During the period of adjournment, the ex-husband still has to pay the present maintenance fees."
The applicant is currently unemployed and she is unable to pay the monthly maintenance of $300 for his son. She received a court order to pay the maintenance which she owes since January 2018.,The applicant should attend the maintenance mediation and ask for a reduction in the maintenance fee since the applicant's son is currently getting allowance from National Service and she is no longer working anymore. May be hard to increase her maintenance since being unemployed for a period of time may not be a sufficient reason to increase the maintenance as her circumstance must change.
"Applicant wishes to get a DNA parental test for his ex-wife's maintenance fee claim. Applicant is already divorced. There was no communication from ex-wife since 2012, applicant stopped paying maintenance fee. Applicant's child is 10 years old. Ex-wife now filed a new claim for maintenance fee. Applicant wants wife to certify that the child is his. ","Applicant was the one who started the lawsuit, and agreed to pay maintenance fee. Applicant also had an obligation to care for his child. 

Applicant can get ex-wife to justify amount of maintenance fee claimed, and needs to give a reason why he does not think that the child is his. Any DNA test done will also be at his own cost. "
"Applicant is currently having difficulty paying maintenance pursuant to a court order. The applicant is supposed to pay $1000 per month. However, he has been paying $500 only for the last 12 months.

Applicant has a son with a woman who is not his wife. She had applied for maintenance for the son. Applicant was not paying for the maintenance. The woman made an application about applicant not paying. Applicant had gone to jail.

Final judgement for divorce was granted in 2015. Lump-sum maintenance to be paid in 3 monthly instalments. At that time, applicant thought that his profits from business can be used to pay. 

Applicant did not pay all 3 instalments. 

Applicant was cheated of SGD 50,000 in his overseas business.

Ex-wife has filed an affidavit asking for what he had signed, the maintenance amount of 100,000 rmp to be paid in 3 monthly instalments.

Applicant can request the court to remove the interest and that he does not have money. 

Applicant can ask his part-time work place to verify that he is working part-time. 

Applicant can go to the embassy and search if ex-wife is married and for which period. Or applicant can ask a lawyer overseas.

If ex-wife was married while married to applicant, it is considered adultery and she should not be claiming for maintenance. Applicant can say that at that time he did not know but now he knows and his marriage can be considered invalid. If she was divorced, the marriage to applicant would be valid. 

If applicant declares bankrupt, he still has to pay maintenance.

"Applicant's ex did not pay money, owes about $7000 for applicant and her children, has not paid for 1.5 years. Ex remarried a foreigner and wants to renounce citizenship and go overseas.

Applicant filed at the maintenance court. 

Applicant has 4 children, of 16, 12, 10 and 4 years old each. 

Court order for maintenance is that ex has to pay until the children turn 21 years old, not until the children attain tertiary education. 

Applicant has changed her will accordingly after the divorce. ","Applicant can go to immigration and ask if the ex can renounce citizenship. She can inform them that the mediation is ongoing. She has to bring a copy of her maintenance application and let ICA know of the application number. 

ICA would not approve the ex's application. It will be on hold until the maintenance settlement is over. Inform ICA now so that if the ex wants to renounce now, he would not be able to. 

Applicant's ex cannot renounce his right as a father. The ex cannot leave the country if there is a court order. Applicant would only be able to intercept the renouncing of the citizenship. 

Applicant can tell the judge that she heard about his renunciation, and that she does not want him to run away without paying. 

If applicant knows where the ex goes to, applicant can engage an overseas lawyer and ask if can reseal a Singapore court order. If cannot, use the order as an evidence and take it up as a civil suit application in the country. 

To get a lump-sum amount, applicant can do an account of the monthly expense and yearly expenses and request for it at the maintenance court."
"Applicant has divorced from her husband. There is a maintenance order of 4050 per month in favour of the applicant and 750 per month for the applicant's child. The maintenance order has been in place since 2010. Applicant alleges that her ex husband still owes her 60,000 dollars in arrears. Applicant is slated to go for an upcoming mediation. ","1. Applicant was told in detail about the mediation process
2. Applicant was told to prepare a list of her monthly expenses for the upcoming mediation session.
3. Applicant was also told that she cannot record during the mediation session. "
"She has filed for a variation order because her daughter is turning 21 end of December. First maintenance order did not include school fees. She wants to vary the order so that her husband will co pay for the university fees till she is done with schooling.

The first order was given when her daughter was in P1. 

She had a conference this morning and the judge did not allow her to file for variation since the child would turn 21 soon. ","A possibility that the judge does not allow would be because the maintenance order never included education fee. 

Lawyer states that she should be able to file for an order since firstly the child is not yet 21 and there is substantial change to the school fees. Possibly use S69 (5)(c) on the Women's Charter since it shows that even if the child has turned 21 years old, she would still be able to attain maintenance fee for education purposes. "
"Applicant was told to attend family court regarding maintenance as ex-husband applied for variation and suspension of maintenance order. Six months ago, there was a maintenance order issued by court for 48 payments of $600 each. He is supposed to pay $600 a month, but husband has not paid for the month of July yet. He is supposed to pay by 6 July but has not done so. They went for mediation and husband has agreed to pay by installment but he does not want to pay and he has been applying to stop the maintenance on the basis of being remarried. Applicant has an accident so she is unable to work. She has two underlying medical conditions as well. She has an upcoming hearing for the variation of maintenance hearing. ","The fact that ex husband has remarried does not mean that obligations to applicant have not stopped. Although his material circumstances may have changed, applicant's material circumstances have not changed. 

Applicant should tell the judge that she has not been served the papers properly, and that she has not replied to the claim. Applicant can try the PJP scheme so that a lawyer can help with the affidavit and filing process. 

Applicant must attend the hearing and must reply because the judge needs to hear the objections and why the maintenance order should not be varied. "
"Son's maintenance from Husband; applicant is trying to claim 17 years worth of maintenance. Applicant claims that it was stated that she had custody of the children and that the husband has to pay maintenance. However, no amount was stated. ","Applicant has to make an application to the Family Court. However, complications arise as to what applicant can claim (i.e. for the child's 17 years of missing maintenance and/or for the future as well). Applicant can try to claim regardless but might not necessarily be successful as the Judge might feel that applicant has waived her rights after 17 years. 

The question is whether the husband in this case has the capacity to pay the amount owed. This action will cost money and applicant has to think it through whether its practical to proceed and that she will get the maintenance as promised even after action commences and is successful. "
"Applicant had divorced husband many years ago, claims that her husband owes her money in alimony. From her documents, it does not appear to have specified any amount of alimony to be given by the husband. ","First, find out whether there are any more documents related to the divorce back in the 80s. 
Second, advisable to get a lawyer since there are many complications including whether the husband (who appears to still be in debt) will have the money to pay any alimony as well as the fact that the courts might take it that applicant has given up any rights to alimony after almost 30 years or more. 
Third, approach legal aid bureau in attempt to get representation/more advice. "
"Has fulfilled 3 years of deed of separation with husband. Husband stated that he would proceed with divorce but since start of year, nothing has been done. 

Have lived separately since 2015. He has stopped paying the access for maintenance since 2016.

Court stated that the conditions written on the deed of separation cannot be enforced.
","She can file for divorce on her end. She can wait for an additional year to file for the divorce without his consent.

She has to file the divorce and in the divorce action apply for orders of court based on what was agreed in the deed of separation.. Strong case for the court to give her the orders based on the deed of separation since it has been agreed upon previously but this conditions must be reasonable. 

She could file for unreasonable behaviour (mental abuse, physical abuse) to expedite the divorce proceedings. However, due to the deed of separation, she cannot state certain stuff and thus ideal solution would be to file for divorce and then file for maintenance. 

File sfor a new maintenance order.

With regards to the maintenance fee defaulted, for the action that can be taken now. 
She could claim as a contract, to file a civil claim under the States Court for the money that her husband defaulted over the years with regards to the maintenance fee. However, this would be costly so there might be no point. 

However, if she wants to claim after her divorce, she can write it as a condition to claim for the arrears and put it in the divorce order itself. "
"Currently paying maintenance for his family. Final judgement was in December 2016. He is currently unemployed (Stopped since July 2016) and he has a lot of problem keeping up with the maintenance fee of $4500 for the 2 kids and $2350 to his ex wife. Ex wife has started working in the beginning of this year. 
","Either go back to his previous lawyer to apply for variation or can go for self representation. 

Speak with his ex wife first with regards to the situation and ask her if she could waive or suspend the payment. If she disagrees, then file the application. Date ranges from 3-6 weeks. Highlight the change in circumstances and how he has made effort to find for employment but was unsuccessful. And also state his wife's income. 

If he defaults payment, his ex wife can claim it as a debt from him or file an application on the basis that he has defaulted on his maintenance payment. If the court finds that he defaults without reason, there would be consequences (eg. jail)."
Applicant filed a maintenance order against her ex husband. Ex Husband claims he has no monies. . Current maintenance is 3200 per month. Ex Husband has not paid her maintenance for quite some time. Applicant claims that her ex husband is hiding his money with his mistress. Applicant also claims that her ex husband is holding a couple of insurance policies. Applicant further claims that her ex husband has sold her shares in their company without her consent.,"- Lawyer was explained about a ""garnishee order"".
- Applicant was advised about potential bankruptcy proceedings against her ex husband. If a bankruptcy order is made, her husband will have to report all his bank accounts and assets to the official assignee.
- Lawyer advised applicant to file an application to court so as to compel her ex husband to pay the owed maintenance. 
- Lawyer advised the applicant to get a lump sum payment rather than monthly payments.
- Lawyer has advised to get as much evidence about alleged forgery regarding the alleged forged share transfers, and thereafter report to the police."
"- Applicant's husband has committed adultery and has left the applicant, The applicant's husband has been giving maintenance. Unfortunately, applicant has been given less monies since may last year.  Applicant and her husband are not yet divorced.

- Applicant has an upcoming mediation session with her husband.

- Applicant has been married for 2.5 years.","- Lawyer has advised the process of a court mediation process. Applicant was further advised to substantiate why she wants to claim 2500 per month ( to bring evidence of receipts and spending habits).

- Applicant has been advised on the divorce process. Applicant's can either employ a lawyer and file for divorce, or she can wait for husband to file for a deed of separation.

- For the owed maintenance, applicant to show evidence of her husband's admittance of the amounts owed during the upcoming mediation process.

- If the husband doesn't agree to give sole custody to the applicant, the court will grant a joint custody. But the applicant will get a high chance of getting care and control of the child. When the court provide a joint custody, the court will probably grant access to her husband once or twice or week. The frequency of the her husband's access will be granted by the court. Applicant was advised to request supervised access."
"The applicant suspects that his ex-wife's child is not his biological daughter. He has been providing maintenance for the child for 5 years. The applicant has been having difficulties in trying to meet up his daughter. During meet ups, he is having difficulties in trying to communicate with her. He does not want to pay any maintenance in the case that the child is not his biological daughter. 
The applicant would like to make a variation application of maintenance for his child. ","Parties should come together to do a DNA test. 
Applicant should engage a lawyer to approach the wife to do a DNA test. The lawyer could draft an undertaking letter to guarantee that the result of the DNA test will not be revealed to a third party other than the court. 
If the wife still refuses to allow the child to take a DNA test, he could use that against her in the court during the maintenance hearing. However, the ground to not undergo a DNA test may not suffice unless the applicant shows new evidence that the child may not his biological daughter. 
The applicant's grounds for suspicion of the child is weak so he should consider if he should make an application for a DNA test. 
Even if he makes a variation order, the applicant would need to show a change in circumstances. However, his case is not strong. "
"He divorced once and he has to pay alimony/ maintenance fee of $3800. He has recently met with the problem of reduction in salary and performance bonus. 

He asked his ex wife if he could reduce his payment from $3800 to $1800 but she was unwilling. His ex wife sued him for owing her $7800 for the past 3 months since he was only willing to pay $1800. 

Mediation centre says he has to file for a variation order. 
","She has the right to file for an order against him for not paying the alimony fee completely since it was already stated in the divorce letter. 

He has to personally go and file for an order. He needs to prove to the court that his financial state has changed, material change in circumstances resulting in him being unable to pay for the alimony fee. Evidence must be given as testimony. 

He has to do this immediately because the court order will still be there at the amount of $3800. There is nothing he can do but pay back the previous amounts due because that is still the court order currently. 

However, this process would take time. Because the court would also need to hear the other party's agreements or objection to the variation in maintenance fee. He should ask a lawyer to do an affidavit for him but ask the lawyer not to state his name in the document since he is afraid that using a lawyer would only complicate matters because his ex wife would get a lawyer too and this would lead to complications and lengthening in court procedures. 


The fact that they do not have children and he gave her $20,000 from CPF, the house as well as $30,000 in cash and $3800 alimony, it would paint him in a better light. Moreover, his ex wife is perfectly normal, although she claims that she had psychological trauma from the divorce she does not have a medical report. And he also has another family to maintain. Thus this would have a higher possibility of success. "
"Applicant is divorced. 
Wife claims that maintenance is insufficient.

Her husband claims that he gave part of the maintenance to their children and that it offset the amount he has to pay for maintenance. Applicant wants to know if this is permissible. ,There is specification of the method of payment of maintenance. Her husband is entitled to pay the maintenance to the children directly. Applicant can apply for a variation of the terms and provide good reasons for the money to come to her first. One of the reasons can be that the maintenance is also for the household. 
"Applicant's husband did not repay the house. Applicant remarried in 2006, and wanted to sell the house. Applicant agreed to, because she thought they could get a new house. Applicant claims that her husband withholds her maintenance sometimes, and decides whether to go to work based on his mood. HDB gave her husband a letter to pay, and he claimed to not have received it. However, Applicant discovered the letter in his drawer. Applicant suggested renting out a room if he is unable to pay, however, Applicant's husband agreed, resulting in arrears of around $32k. Applicant wishes to remove her husband's name from the flat.

Client can also ask the judge for the access of the child, given that the mother is not giving the father access of the child. "
"Applicant wants to apply for a variation of maintenance. When the agreement was first drafted, it did not include monies for education. The daughter is turning 21 soon, and is entering university soon. The ex husband refuses to contribute to the daughter's university fees.",Apply for a variation of maintenance and let the court decide the amount for university fees. The court will look at the needs of the child. Children's first degree costs are not unreasonable. Apply for the variation before child turns 21.
"Client wish to enforce maintenance order on the husband for 2 children; 8 and 10 years old); separated from the husband, client's husband has not turned up twice for the mediation. ","It is up to the direction of the judge to enforce a declaration of the husband's income. Client was advised to request the court for warrant of arrest to hasten the process and hopefully the client's husband would pay up for the maintenance. Also it was advised to the client to request the release of the passports of the children. It is also unlikely the father will not likely to get care and control of the children given that the children are looked after by the mother since their birth.

Client need to impress on the judge the case is time sensitive and there is material change for the children and the accommodation in Indonesia.

No enforcement for the sale of the matrimony house; it is unlikely that the client can request for the court to get the matrimony home to be sold if the client's and her husband are still married. She is only able to get a portion of the matrimony home unless the client proceed with a divorce settlement.

Client is also advised to communicate with the husband to resolve with the maintenance issue; the alternative legal route will be costly and time consuming."
"Divorce case. Applicant has not concluded the divorce case yet, however has begun paying maintenance. However he has just changed a job, and due to a pay cut he wants to cut the maintenance to $300. Applicant seeks to vary the maintenance amount.

","Applicant informed that he needs to get the final judgement from court before he can apply to vary the maintenance amount. Before then, he must negotiate with his wife or her lawyers to ask to lower the maintenance amount for this interim period. 

Advised to email the wife's lawyer to ask about the status of the case and that he wants to make an application to vary the maintenance, and to ask for all other relevant documents to be emailed to him since he is no longer staying at his residential address. If there is an interim judgement, he can try to negotiate to vary it, in the family courts."
"The court order states that the customer was to pay $550 per month as maintenance for his children. This order was made 10 years ago. 2 of his children are now grown up, and have started working. The customer does not know exactly when his children started working. ","Since the initial $550 was to be paid for 3 children, the sum can be divided by 3, with the customer paying only 1/3 since 2 of his children are grown up, and have started working. 

The customer can tell the court how much extra he has paid for his 2 grown children, counting from the date that they each started working. 

Referral to PJP."
"Applicant filed a PPO against her husband a year ago. This resulted in her husband filing for divorce. The PPO was later withdrawn as her husband pledged an undertaking. 

Applicant was unhappy with the way her then lawyer handled the divorce and MSS/PPO issues, and discharged him in April through e-mail. There was no official discharge of the lawyer in front of a judge. She wrote an email to former lawyer asking for her files and affidavits, but has not received anything. She does not wish to pay them the full sum of their lawyers' fees as their work has been unsatisfactory.

Her new lawyers have taken up the divorce case, but do not wish to take up the MSS/PPO case as they have not been there for the majority of the MSS/PPO case.

She wrote to the court two weeks ago, informing them that she was in the dark as to the processes and what was required of her, but has not yet received a response.","Applicant was advised that ex-lawyer can withhold her documents and affidavits if she had not made payment for their services. She was advised to contact them again.

She was advised about the rough procedure for MSS/PPO claims.

She was advised to write a follow-up e-mail to court regarding her previous query."
Applicant's income is unable to support his daughter's maintenance of $1000. His initial application to change the court order and lower the maintenance was rejected by the court.,Applicant can re-apply to lower his daughter's maintanence but filling up the necessary forms is a long and difficult process. Applicant was advised to engage a lawyer. 
"Applicant is applying for a maintenance order of $700 but the respondent is flying to overseas

Applicant may be unable to serve the papers in time. ","Unfortunately, unless the Family Justice Court issues a warrant of arrest and prevents the respondent from leaving Singapore, it is likely that Applicant will face delays in filing the maintanence order. "
"Applicant needs to appeal against the Family Court's order suspending her 6-month's child maintenance and tuition fee as the husband claimed that he was unemployed and resigned. Husband used to work as a clerk at a law firm. When Applicant called the firm, they said he left in March. Husband was theoretically employed during the time of the order. He amended and edited his payslip to get the order in his favour.","Can appeal on the basis that what has been presented in court has been untrue. Prove that at the time court order was made, he was still working in the law firm. Try to get his boss to confirm her facts."
"Applicant has depression and was retrenched in April. He is also a divorcee but is no longer able to pay Maintenance of $1,000 per month since June. ","He has to continue paying the Maintenance since it is based on a court order. He should also settle the matter as soon as possible before the Maintenance accumulates. 

He should go to Family Court immediately to reduce the Maintenance he has to pay since he is retrenched. He also needs to get a medical certificate stating that he is depressed.

Try PJP since he does not qualify for help from Legal Aid Bureau. He can also try the Adhoc pro bono scheme. 

Merits of his case: 
Based on the facts, there are acclaimed merits for a downward variation of the existing Maintenance order specifically as the applicant can no longer secure alternate employment owing to his medical condition. The applicant is further handicapped by virtue of the fact that he is unable to read or write English and would be unable to represent himself in the preliminary stages of filing the appropriate documents in court for the variation. There is some urgency in this matter as delay would result in arrears accruing and exposing the applicant to the possibility of being unable to pay them and being sanctioned by the court., It is my view that Ad hoc pro bono should be granted. For your consideration. "
"The applicant wishes to contend the maintenance fee ordered by the court. The applicant is not eligible for legal aid. The applicant is required to pay $3000 for security of cost. The applicant has claimed that he has paid for the maintenance fees but it was not recorded. The applicant has care and control over one child while his ex-wife has care and control over the other two. His ex-wife was supposed to look after his children but she failed to do so and he had to engage a maid in order to look after the children. As he and his ex-wife have lived together despite being divorced, she had constantly taken money from the applicant as they had not agreed on strict terms how the maintenance should be paid out. The court order had failed to include how the maintenance fees should be paid. The applicant contends that he has been paying for the daily expenses of his children through tuition fees and other expenses.",File a notice of appeal in order to contest the issue of maintenance fees for his children and ex-wife
"Went to family court. The applicant is not married to her partner. The applicant has three children with her partner. The applicant is currently living in a terrace house with her partner and the three children. The partner has refused to pay for maintenance for the applicant and the child they have together. The applicant claims that her partner has in excess of a few million in his bank account. However he refuses to pay for any maintenance for his children and the applicant. The applicant wishes to seek maintenance for her children. The applicant's partner used to work in the government sector, she claims that her partner has refused to pay for any of the children's daily expenses. The applicant claims that due to her partner's age of 70 he has victimised himself and has painted the applicant as an individual who is after his money. ",The applicant has only $20 in her bank account. She is likely to be eligible for legal aid. She requires to have evidence against her partner in order to gain the money she wishes from him. She should apply for legal aid as soon as possible in order to sue him for the money he owes for maintenance fee. 
"He has issues with his wife, currently divorced. Monetary matters caused his wife to go to the court. He has been made bankrupt last October and has not had the money to pay the money. Wife has asked for more money again, so he is having trouble paying. Court has asked him to pay $1100 for the maintenance of his 4 children. Currently he is not doing well, since 2016, has not enough money to live, lost his job in March. Currently driving with private-hire, but business has not been good since another private-hire company left the market.

Wife did not ask for enforcement until last month. When the order was first issued he was not yet a bankrupt, was only made bankrupt in June or July 2017. He says that it's not that he does not want to pay, but that he cannot do so.

He has been thinking of going ahead with the divorce, and allowing his wife to take the house and his savings.","Inform the court of change in circumstances, given that he has since been made a bankrupt. Possible that he could get the maintenance lowered, since his children are no longer in school. Need to prove that he has lost his job and is really not able to pay the monthly maintenance.

Look for a new job as soon as possible, as court would not like the fact that he has lingered and not found a job.

It is possible to give his wife the whole flat, and maintenance might be avoided due to the fact that his both are working and he is actually entitled to a portion of the flat. Maintenance is not an automatic right today.

Advised to go to Legal Aid Bureau to seek further legal advice, would help him to advise on all these matters. If not granted, then go to PJP."
"Applicant had an affair with a lady and a child was born. He has been giving her maintenance fee. He found out that the lady was not faithful and was having an affair. The child is 11 years old now and he suspected that the child was not his. He did not pay for the maintenance fee and there is a maintenance order against him. He asked for DNA test but the lady refused. The lady cancelled the maintenance order hence from now onwards, he does not need to pay. He is feeling very unhappy now because he feels that he is cheated. He also has concerns over the child's birth certificate because his name is inside. ","It is unlikely that the court will compel her to run the DNA test for the child as the lady is no longer asking him to pay the maintenance fees. If he wants to find out if the child is really his, he can engage a private investigator. 

Regarding the child's birth certificate, he should make a will to protect his property and assets. "
Applicant is a divorce. Her former husband gives her maintenance fee of $1. Now she faces economic difficulties as she fell sick with breast cancer. Now she wishes to increase her maintenance fees.,She has the right to do so. She needs to go to the family court to ask for application to vary final judgment. She needs to employ lawyers to write affidavit on why she wants to demand for more maintenance fee.
"Applicant confronted her husband regarding his infidelity. He got upset and threatened to cut her and their children off financially.

She does not wish to divorce her husband for the sake of her children, as she believes that her husband will use their children as a means of hurting her after the divorce. Applicant is not local and has not been in the workforce for years. Their older daughter has dyslexia and ADHD, so the cost of her special needs care is very high.","Appliacnt was advised that she is entitled to file for maintenance, and that the standard of maintenance is to the level of life that they accustomed to.

"Applicant's husband abruptly left the home a year ago. She then applied for maintenance from her husband, who subsequently served her divorce papers on the grounds that they had been separated for 3 years. This is untrue as they have only been separated for a year. She was married for 8 years. ",Applicant was advised to get her own lawyer. 
"Applicant is currently paying maintenance $400/mth or his daughter (18yo), under the care of his ex-wife. Applicant is caregiver of his son, but is not receiving maintenance for him. Applicant wishes to lower the maintenance paid from $400 to $200. 

Applicant alleges that his ex-wife is not taking good care of the daughter. The daughter is currently taking a study break, and is apparently suffering from depression. Occasional arguments break out between the daughter and the mother, leading to the daughter going to the applicant's house to seek refuge for around 3months.","Advised that an application for the variation of maintenance needs to be coupled with evidence to show a material change in circumstances for either party. In this case, applicant has been taking loans to pay for the new home (since much of the share of the matrimonial home was given to the ex-wife). Furthermore, the ex-wife was previously working part-time, but is now working full time.

Informed that with decisions relating to the custody of the daughter, since she was already 18 yo, she was allowed to decide for herself where she wanted to stay. Advised that it was likely that the courts will ask the daughter where she wanted to stay if there was a fight for custody. As such, advised the applicant to talk directly with the daughter as to where she wanted to stay permanently. If daughter decided to stay with the applicant permanently, there was no longer a need to pay maintenance to the ex-wife for the daughter.

Advised applicant to apply for maintenance to be paid to him (for his son) if he wanted it. "
"Applicant was separated from his wife, who is not a Singapore citizen. His issue is regarding maintenance. He has to pay $21000 in arrears. Applicant has 6 children. 

Applicant is now proposing to repay the arrears by increasing his monthly payment from $350 to $600 until he repays the $21000. Every 3 months, he will review and pay an additional $1000-3000. However, his wife has rejected this proposal at mediation.

Applicant had defaulted on payment because of unemployment problems. He had found a job overseas which earns him about $2000/month.

Applicant was overseas when the court order was served.","Applicant has to work out suitable payment terms. Applicant should explain his situation to the court that he was unable to pay because of his own personal expenses.

Applicant should have asked to vary the maintenance amount.

Applicant may approach legal aid since his income is not earned local.

Advised to fix an amount instead of just $1000-3000.

Applicant to explain to the court why he did not show up in court (applicant was overseas and papers were not served on him).

Applicant may want to consider engaging a lawyer if it is within his means."
"Applicant has a stepdaughter, 21 years old. Stepdaughter was impregnated by her 18 years old ex-boyfriend (A/P) 1 and half years ago. Stepdaughter fought for maintenance at family court where judge decided
on maintenance of $50 only (since A/P keep claiming that he is still a student).

A/P mentioned in text messages that he will take care of the child when stepdaughter informed him of the pregnancy. However, A/P and his parents approach the stepdaughter separately to persuade her to abort the child (have call recordings).

The mother of A/P assaulted Applicant's wife (mother of stepdaughter) where she threatened to file for custody if Applicant's side file for maintenance. When Applicant's wife was about to take video of them threatening, she was slapped 2 times by the A/P's mother. A/P was also scolding vulgarities at Applicant's stepdaughter.

Even during dating period, stepdaughter had to bear most of the expenses as the mother of A/P cut off all allowances when she found out about them dating. 

A/P's mother was ex-principal at a childcare centre. Applicant told the school about how she asked his stepdaughter to abort the child and also about instances where she brought up some of the situations of kids in the childcare. Subsequently, she was dismissed and she claimed that she was harassed by Applicant.","A/P is the guardian as he is not legally registered as father yet. However, there must have been an instance where Applicant's stepdaughter and A/P mutually agreed to get a child (if not will be considered as rape already). By law, A/P has to maintain the child hence there is already a right to file for maintenance. Thus, the court has decided on $50 as maintenance. It may not be much now since A/P does not have means to maintain the child. However, the stepdaughter can file for a higher maintenance in the future when the A/P has an income.

The medical expenses were paid by stepdaughter and her mother. Hence, need to think of who should file the claim against A/P. Would be better if Applicant's stepdaughter make the claim as it can then be seen as an extension of maintenance. Told Applicant that he can check out guardianship of infants act and women's charter on this issue so that they have a better understanding of where they can file the claim against A/P.
"
"Applicant's ex-husband is required to pay maintenance for her children. It was omitted in the court order regarding the maintenance for the child. Applicant's ex-husband was given custody for care and control of the children, but has pushed this responsibility to the applicant's mother, and agreed to pay maintenance for the children is a separate written agreement. However, in the month of April, he gave a maintenance of less than the agreed amount. He remains uncontactable. ","Applicant advised to file an application to the family courts. It is likely he gave the reduced maintenance because he has come into financial problems. Even if they receive a court order, they will be unable to enforce it if he does not have the financial means to make the payment. "
Applicant's ex-husband has not sold his unit as was ordered in a divorce judgement in 2001. Now he is living in America and is still unwilling to sell the unit. He has also recently lapsed in his payment of maintenance for the year of 2018.,"Applicant needs to make an application for a registrar empowerment clause. She should make a few more attempts to get him to sell. After which then she can make the application to the courts for the registrar empowerment clause. Regarding the lapsed maintenance payment, she has to get another summons.

To make the application for the clause, Applicant can either do it on her own or she can get a lawyer. She will need to prepare the summons and then serve it on her ex in America. The procedure can be quite hard if she is not familiar with it. She can go to PJP. Can also try approaching Legal Aid Bureau to see if she qualifies."
"Applicant is a single mother and has applied for child maintenance. She has attended mediation from the father (A/P) but it failed. She wants to know what to expect of the mentions, as well as how to prepare the documents needed. A/P had suggested that if mediation fails, he wants a DNA test. A/P was recently in debt, but claims he has been in debt for a long time.","Applicant does not need an affidavit if she is acting in person. She needs to prepare her expenses. Applicant doesn't have to give the questions she wants to ask A/P before the hearing. Easier to prepare a table of contents in her list of expenses. Applicant will be given time for cross examination during the hearing, subject to however long the judge allows. There will be a chance for concluding statements. Applicant has to be on-track with her statements and keep them straight to the point - she must show relevance with her questions. Applicant cannot refer to whatever was discussed at mediation as it is without prejudice. Applicant should just submit her list of expenses first. Whatever she wants to bring up in court, Applicant has to give notice to the other party as well. If A/P's personal debts are heavy, the courts will have to be reasonable and fair in deciding how much maintenance he should pay. Mudslinging is not allowed. Applicant has to prove that what she is claiming for is fair. The judge can question the parties in the hearing to ask any relevant questions at any time. Applicant can only present her case based on what she stated in her list of expenses. Things may drag if there are more than one mention, depending on whether there are any complications in the case. Applicant is not bound by the proposal she presented in mediation. The hearing judge cannot refer to the notes taken from the mediation. Before Applicant gets a hearing date, she has to make sure she is clear that she has put down whatever she wants to present in her submissions. "
"Applicant is currently paying maintenance for his wife, who stays overseas. However, recently he claims that his company is about to retrench him. He fears he will be unable to pay maintenance while he is unemployed, and would like to ask the courts to allow him to cease payment of maintenance in the meantime. Applicant has applied for Singapore citizenship but has not obtained it yet. 
 ","Applicant will still have to pay maintenance, but he can apply for a variation of the court order. He will have to explain to the courts how much he is able or unable to pay. Can also apply to the courts to cease payment for a period of time. Can try to apply for LAB. Until the variation order is given, he is still bound by the previous court order. "
"Applicant was forced to sign an agreement for her to pay a sum of $10,000 to her eldest son. Applicant's ex-husband has not been paying maintenance.","Applicant has to apply to court to vary the court order. 

Applicant cannot use maintenance to offset the $10,000 she is required to pay for her son. Applicant needs to go down to the court to enforce the court order for maintenance. Applicant can separately deal with the other matter.

Applicant does not qualify for legal aid and has no resources to engage a lawyer to help her with the proceedings.

Alternatively, applicant can wait until she receives a court order before deciding on her next course of action."
"Applicant is self-represented as a plaintiff for a variation of maintenance for his son and his ex-wife. He has set out the reasons for his material change in circumstances. No reply to affidavit has been given yet.

Applicant has an unofficial agreement with his future brother-in-law regarding the purchase of a house, and would like to know if he can raise that liability as a material change in circumstances","Tomorrow, there will either be an adjournment for his ex-wife to file a response, or if she agrees to the variation, the judge will grant it. Until the order is varied, the earlier order stands and he still has to give maintenance. 

He can appeal within 14 days for orders given in the District Court. 

He cannot use voice recordings as evidence in Singapore. 

He can show the court whatever liabilities he has, so long as they are not illegal, and it is up to the courts to decide on whether they want to accept it as a reason to affect his liability to his first family. No matter what, he still has the responsibility to take care of his first family. 

Wanting to start a new family is a factor in a material change in circumstances, but it is up for the judge to decide the weight of it. The judge will also look at how well his ex-wife is currently doing. He can try to show the court that his ex-wife is now well to do, in contrast to his current financial state."
"Applicant married a Singaporean man in Feb 2016, who has since moved out and abandoned her. The wedding was registered with ROM. They lived together after getting married for 1 year 6 months. They consummated the marriage but had no children together. He worked as a property agent and hence Applicant did not need to work. Applicant found out that he had committed adultery with another woman, and also had photographic evidence in the form of naked photos sent by the other woman to her husband. In Nov 2017, her husband moved out. Applicant then found a job to support herself.

Applicant is currently on an LTVP which is expiring soon. ","If Applicant wants a divorce, she needs to be married for 3 years, and hence will have to wait until Feb 2019. They are currently already separated. Then, she can proceed on divorce based on unreasonable behaviour. She could tell the courts that he did not support her, was not loving towards her, and came home very late each night. She should save her evidence of his infidelity for use in the future in her statement of particulars if she takes this to court for divorce next year. 

If she wants to have divorce by separation, she has to wait for 3 years. Divorce by separation of 3 years will have to be by consent, and is no-fault. During this 3 years, they cannot have sex. If she wants to divorce before that, she will have to go on grounds of unreasonable behaviour. 

Right now, since she is not working, she can go to family courts and ask for maintenance. Thereafter, she should wait until Feb next year and get a lawyer to divorce her husband based on unreasonable behaviour."
Applicant has since remarried. He has lost his previous job and is earning a lot less now. He is still paying $1801 in maintenance and would like to know if he can apply to reduce the maintenance amount. ,"Maintenance is typically for life. Applicant can make an application with the family court to vary maintenance based on material change of circumstances. Applicant needs a summon, as well as an affidavit. He should highlight his change of financial situation in his affidavit, but not in a malicious way. In general, 21 is the age where maintenance for children ends, but is subject to other factors eg university studies. Applicant can file these documents at Chinatown Point or at the Supreme Court. "

This year applicant receives $2000 per month on paper, but still receives $7.5k monthly.
The terms agreed on so far is to leave the house out of the picture. Applicant agreed on shared custody and maintenance ($1000 for her and $1000 for child). Husband said he does not want to have black and white $7500, though he is still willing to pay $7500. Matrimonial home has not been settled yet.","Everything should be in black and white (matrimonial home and maintenance was not accurately reflected in the simplified divorce).
Because IJ is tomorrow, if applicant does not do anything, it means she agrees to all the terms. Go to family court today and say that she wants to contest it, and stop the IJ. Say that when she signed, she did not have legal advice, and that she might get a lawyer now. Write to the husband's lawyers saying when she signed she did not have legal advice, and now she does not agree.
She can get a lawyer for PJP.
Because she is contesting it now, she will have to fight for the $7500 and he might not agree."

Applicant was enquiring regarding variation of maintenance fees from divorce agreement. Applicant is currently unemployed.,Advised to go to the legal aid bureau for help. Look for lawyer to look apply for variation from there to lower the fee due to inability to sustain payment for the maintenance of ex-wife given current economic situation.. 
"Applicant would like to vary his maintenance fees, which he previously entered into consensually some two years ago.

He currently pays $1,600 for the three children. ","Applicant needs to take out an application, a summons, to request for a variation of the order. 
In submitting the application, the applicant needs to submit the following documents: payslip, expenses, debt repayment etc.
However, critically, the applicant needs to show that he has faced a material change since the time he has entered into the maintenance fee agreement, e.g. his salary has fallen, he has incurred debts etc. 
Further, he can claim that he has been overpaying the maintenance fees. Upon a calculation based on the applicant and his ex-wife's salary, his payment of 550 for a primary school child would mean that the child's expenses amount to $1650; this indicates that he has indeed been overpaying.
Applicant needs to show that his wife indeed earns $8000 as he has claimed.
On these bases, applicant is advised to find a family lawyer."
"The applicant and his ex spouse are divorced 5 years ago. The applicant was represented by a lawyer under Legal Aid for his divorce proceedings. His ex spouse is seeking the sum of S$1,600.00 for maintenance for herself and the children of the marriage, aged 16 and 11. The applicant's current salary is S$1,800.00. He transferred a sum of S$30,000.00 CPF monies from his CPF account to his ex spouse's CPF account. The applicant also transferred the matrimonial flat to his ex spouse. There was an Order of Court (by consent) that states that the applicant has to pay his ex spouse the sum of S$1,600.00 for maintenance for her and the children of the marriage. When the applicant consented to the Order of Court, he was working as an insurance agent earning a monthly salary of slightly more than S$2,000.00. He thought that he would be able to afford the sum of S$1,600.00 if he works hard enough. He was retrenched recently and can no longer afford to pay the sum of S$1,600.00 for the maintenance. The applicant can only afford to pay S$200.00 for maintenance at the moment as he is undergoing treatment for a medical condition. He would only be able to change to a job with higher salary when he recovers from that medical condition. The applicant has attended the first mediation session. The second mediation session is scheduled to be on next week.","The applicant should apply to the Family Justice Courts for a variation of the Order of Court to vary the sum of maintenance.

The applicant should try to re-apply for Legal Aid to assist him with the variation of the Order of Court. If he does not qualify for Legal Aid, he would have to do the variation himself as he does not have the financial means to engage a private lawyer at the moment."

"Area of law: Family Law - Maintenance. There was a Draft Consent Order filed some time in December 2016. There was an order for maintenance for the children of the marriage at S$250.00 per month. The children's expenses are S$3,300.00 per month currently. The applicant wish to apply for a variation of the Order to increase the maintenance.","The applicant may apply to the Courts for a variation of the Order.

The applicant may not apply to the Courts to change from joint custody to sole custody just because the applicant feels that her ex spouse was not responsible enough towards the children of the marriage."

The applicant used to work 2 jobs and earns about $1400  month. His parents are both ill. He and his wife are in the midst of divorce proceedings. The judge wants him to pay $1615 for his daughter's maintenance fees. This was decided before the divorce proceedings. They are currently at the division of assets stage. Both parties have legal representation. The wife is asking for more maintenance. ,"The applicant should ask his lawyer to try and change the maintenance amounts, especially since his financial position has changed, since he is already represented. He can ask his lawyer to ask the judge to reconsider the maintenance issue at the division of assets stage, since it will also be fairer. "
"The applicant wishes to seek advice on a maintenance matter.
Her spouse had cut her maintenace by half due to one of the applicant's children turning 21 years old. Previously, the applicant's maintenance was $700, now it is cut to $350.

The applicant is worried as although one of her child has turned 21 years old and can support herself, her cost of living and expenses that has to be incurred has risen. Previously, she was staying with her mom who provided meals for her but now she is living at her own place.
Furthermore, her other child is in secondary 4, and expenses that have to paid include transport, meals, etc. the applicant is also worried about financing her other child's further education

The applicant is working part-time in two clinics and takes home around $1,800 a month.
The applicant complains that the ex-spouse stops visiting her children and does not care about them.
The applicant is concerned that if her second child needs to pursue further education, he would refuse to pay and that the $350 maintenance would not be enough.
","1) The lawyer advised her that how much she can get depends on her needs. He is of the opinion that the applicant's ex-spouse was right in cutting the maintenance in half in the sense once the child turns 21, he doesn't need to pay any more maintenance for that child.

Lawyer advises that the best way would be to negotiate. However, it seems that her ex-spouse isn't interested in her life anymore. So negotiation might not be viable.

what the applicant could do is to take out a consent order and say that there was a change of circumstances. However, the court is unlikely to disturb a consent order so she would need strong justification. Still, the lawyer thinks that she has a strong case due to the increase in cost of living, concerns about her second child's further education, transport, money allowance, etc. 

The lawyer then advised her on the procedure involved in varying a consent order. One of the intial steps she should take is to proceed to CrimsonLogic and do e-litigation matter.

The lawyer advised the applicant that she would not need to go to a big firm to deal with this matter, and the matter is not particularly complex. 

2) the family justice project requires both parties to be willing to apply for it. On the event the ex-spouse ignore her it would be difficult to go further. The lawyer advised her to try the legal aide bureau to see if she qualifies.

"The applicant has a maintenance order, and the maintenance is supposed to be from the sale of the flat. Now, the husband has brought an application to the court to vary the order and also wants custody of the child. The divorce was in 2016, and the IJ was in July. The arrangement for the IJ was that 40% of the sale of the flat was to become her maintenance. This agreement was done in the mediation. The Final Order did not really cover maintenance.

The husband wants to extend the sale of the house for 12 more months, and he wants to sell it at a lower price, which will negatively impact the maintenance that she receives. The applicant wants to go back to the previous maintenance order, although the lawyer from the LAB told her that this is a totally different matter. ","1. If the applicant is trying to claim over the share of the flat, then it will be very difficult for her to do so. When the husband varies the order, the applicant can ask the judge to increase the amount. She can tell him that under the previous order, she was supposed to get 40% of $420k, and whatever he varies it to, she must get that same sum.  

She can also try to claim for child maintenance because it is not covered in the IJ.

2. If the applicant wants the remaining 60%, she needs to show to the court that it is fair. For example, she can say that $168k is for her maintenance, and the remaining $152k could possibly be argue through child maintenance - for this, she needs to calculate how much she needs per month, and then calculate it all the way till when the children reach 21 or finish university. If the applicant's priority is to keep the flat, then she could opt for this, but this would not mean that she does not get additional child maintenance. She can also tell the court that she is going to take over the remaining mortgage. 

The applicant will go to LAB to get a lawyer. "
"Applicant asking on behalf of her brother who has been in jail for 5 years. His ex-wife sued him for maintenance at the Family Court. The money is for the applicant's brother's two sons. The case has been going on for quite a long time. The start of this is because the ex-wife did not let the brother see the sons, and then the brother thereafter did not want to pay the maintenance fee. 

Applicant asked her to stop for a few months while they wait for a new tenant in their property, so that they can use the money to pay the maintenance fee. In addition to that, the ex-wife had previously told the applicant to ""forget about the whole thing"". However, the ex-wife keeps asking for payment because the applicant's brother has property and can pay. The ex-wife did not get anything out of the property because the applicant's brother bought it as a single. 

The applicant feels very threatened by the wife's communication with them because she likes to use the court's name. For example, she likes to say, ""the court will confiscate the property"". She also likes to twist her words. For example, she will attend court and when the brother wants to see his children, then she will deny him. 

Next hearing date is 19th. At the previous hearing, which was about 3 years ago,the applicant and her brother both attended, where the ex-wife asked for $100/month more. 


Previously, they paid her $400/month, but they would like to reduce the maintenance to $200/month.","1. It is understandable that the brother will not be able to pay for the period that he is in prison, and he/his family should not have to pay. The family actually does not have to do anything. To reduce the amount, the applicant's brother should request for a reduction in the maintenance at the next hearing. The case for reduction/not paying maintenance while the applicant's brother is in jail is not very strong because the maintenance is for the children and not for the wife. 

2. Complaints are from the ex-wife, not the court. 

3. The wife cannot be stopped from doing this because in the court's eyes, there is a court order that she is trying to enforce. If it is not a matter of sending threatening messages, then there is nothing much that you can do. There is nothing to stop her from lying, other than to catch her in her lie, where they go to court and he tells the judge that she does not let him see his children. 

4. With regard to the next hearing, the court will probably get the brother to come attend.
 
5. On application by the ex-wife, the court can make an order to sell the property.

6. If the family does not attend the hearing, then they will not know. The easiest way to do this is to find out from the applicant's brother, or to attend court themselves because the judge usually gives the order there and then.

7. The court sends the notices, and has them pasted on the door of the house. 
"
Applicant wants to know if he needs to do any procedures to stop his son's maintenance after he turns 21 years old. ,"Method 1: Both sides agree, to shortening the duration of the son's maintenance. 
Method 2: Able to file variation of court order. Write a letter to the court at CrimsonLogic to clarify when the Applicant can stop giving maintenance. The easiest way is to write a letter to clarify.

"Applicant is seeking to vary a maintenance order, regarding maintenance he has to pay to his ex-wife

It would be apposite to provide a few background facts: 
After divorce from his ex-wife, Applicant has sole care and control of the four children between Applicant and his ex-wife. Applicant has to pa $1,000 as maintenance to the ex-wife. However, back then he agreed for such maintenance because he had mone from the selling of the matrimonial flat. This gave him the ability to support four people and pay her at the same time. But over a year, the pool of money from the sale of the matrimonial flat was already depleted. Currently, given that he has to take care of four children and himself, and to hire a house helper to take care of the children while he is working, his expenses are more than his salary.

He then took out a summons against her to vary the maintenance order, and the judge decided to vary the maintenance from $1,000 to $500 (not entirely sure that this is the exact amount).  However, currently, he is unsatisfied with this amount and wants the maintenance amount to be brought further down to $1.

another issue is regarding care and control of the four children. His ex-wife has on several occasions taken the children from him without first seeking his permission. His ex-wife had ""bribed"" the two younger children of the family with Ipads which made them reluctant to come home. 
","Regarding the procedure involved in an Appeal, he recommended Applicant to go to crimson logic on the 9th floor of china town point. The counter girls there would be very helpful in guiding them through the procedure.

The lawyer also emphasized to them the deadline for appeal, which is 14 days from the verdict. They would need to quickly engage a lawyer and file notice to the other party

On  the issue on how to present their case to persuade the judge to vary the court order, the lawyer told them they would first need the grounds of judgement. This is because in an appeal, they would need to argue how the court below as erred, and this requires them to have the grounds of judgement of the court below.

Regarding the issue of the ex-wife constantly taking Applicant's children without his permission, the lawyer recommended that he should go file a police report. While Applicant was interested in making contempt of court submission, the lawyer recommended against that as there would need to be a penal clause in the court order granting Teo sole custody and control.

Thus, upon only after making the police report that she breach the court order, should Applicant try to make an application to the court to ask the judge to have a penal clause included into the court order. If she breaches the court order again, then Applicant can make a submission to the court that his ex-wife is in contempt of court.

Finally, the lawyer emphasized that family law is a complicated area of law, and recommended Teo to seek legal advice rather than to settle everything by himself."
"Applicant and his wife were just married last year. The wife filed a divorce on December 2 2017. Notably, the reason for the marriage was because the wife was pregnant with Applicant's baby. The baby was born on 2nd December 2017.

Currently, the wife wants to undergo a divorce with Applicant due to Applicant being without a job.
The stepfather is asking for $30,000 from Applicant (for labour bills that he paid), and Applicant had agreed to a $800 maintenance to pay to his wife ($500 for the baby, $300 for the wife). He had signed a maintenance agreement regarding this.

Applicant is going to work as a bell-hop at marina bay sands hotel. The salary would be $1450 a month. His wife earns roughly $3,000 a month.

This marriage was a marriage of love. Applicant knew his wife from secondary school.



","First of all, given that Applicant was unemployed, it was recommended that he seek legal aide.

Regarding the issue of divorce, the lawyer said that it would not happen. This is because a couple can only divorce only after 3 years of marriage. In this case, they were only married 2 months ago, and the wife had lived in his place for a month (so the marriage is taken to have been consummated) 

Regarding the issue of maintenance, the lawyer recommended Applicant to take out an application to vary the maintenance. This is given that the wife of Pang earned more than him. However, it is important to note that Applicant had already signed an agreement regarding the maintenance.

Regarding the issue of access to the child, the lawyer recommended Applicant to engage a lawyer and take out an application for access to the child. Though it must be noted that the court would usually let the mother take care of the child. Access to the child may only be in the form of visiting the child at the mother's place, and if Applicant wishes to take the child out of the house, it might be difficult"
"Area of Law: Family Law. Her ex spouse filed for divorce at the Syariah Court in Indonesia. Her ex spouse filed for the divorce based on the ground that she did not fulfill her duty as a wife. She has sole custody, care and control of both children of the marriage, aged 11 and 10. Her ex spouse has been committing family violence on her. She was admitted to shelter for 3 times due to the family violence and is currently still staying in shelter with her youngest child. Her ex spouse took the eldest child away from her. She has applied for PPO for herself and her children. She applied for maintenance for herself and her children at the Family Justice Courts. She has a hearing on next Monday. Her ex spouse told her that he would strike out the maintenance application. She seek help from Pro Bono and they said that they will assign her a lawyer.",She could ask for adjournment for her hearing on next Monday as she has not been assigned a lawyer.
"The client is working and her husband is working too. They have one son (16). The father does not do anything for the family (client and son included). He beat the son and the son told her he wants to beat his father. The threat of violence seems likely so she wants to apply for maintenance for her son. The Family Justice Court told her that she can apply for monthly maintenance. She wants to divorce him after he sets up a lump sum payment for her son so that he cannot tell her he does not work and need to pay. 

There is a suspected illegal son of the husband whom he is paying for, because the boy worked in the shop and the husband is paying for way more things than necessary, including the wedding. As of now, they are living together but live very separate lives. 
",She should apply for a divorce and get matrimonial assets divided. She can apply to HDB to get enough for her and her son so that she can convince the court to give her more of the money. She needs to get maintenance for herself and her son so that she can get more money. She can also lodge a police report if they are violent (personal protection order) but it seems unnecessary. 
"The client just appealed for maintenance and has a hearing on 29 Jan. 2010 found the husband to be cheating, therefore the client lives apart from her husband despite still being legally married. Trying to appeal for maintenance as husband has not been making sufficient contribution. The client opened a case in 2017 November and has since been receiving small amounts of money ($100~) from her husband inconsistently. 

The client needs more money for maintenance to take care of her family as she covers utility bills, raising the children, works part time","The court needs to know how much money the husband is giving the client. Additionally the actions of the client's husband is not necessarily related to the maintenance. Maintenance for the son not being related is up to the husband to prove.

Recommended what to bring as evidence to decide how much maintenance: 

-part time job
-taking care of son
-paying for the house loan
-paying for utility bills on behalf of the whole family"
Applicant wants to know what is the duration for maintenance claim for wife and child. Applicant is divorced and her husband has not been paying the maintenance sums as agreed upon. ,Applicant is advised that maintenance claim for children ends when the child turns 21. Applicant advised to calculate a lump sum of maintenance and apply to the family court for the monthly maintenance sum to be changed to a lump sum. 
Applicant wishes to appeal against Divorce court final judgment of maintenance. A variation of this order has been made. Applicant stopped paying maintenance of children because son has stopped going for tuition.,"Applicant has 14 days to file notice of appeal. However, Applicant is advised that the judge is mostly likely cognisant of the change in circumstances pleaded by Applicant. Applicant must show that the judge has failed to consider particular facts, or has erred in the application of the law.

If Applicant loses his appeal in its entirety, Applicant must continue to pay for the counterparty's costs. Should Applicant decide to withdraw the appeal, counterparty can ask for costs. These costs are decided by court guidelines, and not necessarily pegged to the actual invoice from the counterparty's lawyer."
"Applicant was divorced in 1999. The monthly maintenance is $400 for his child and $50 for his ex-wife. He used to have a company, and now works part time now and earns $450 per month. Child was born in August 1993. He paid up till this month. The child stays with his ex-wife, but both of them moved house. He wants to reduce it to $200 because he earns much lesser now.","If there is a material change in circumstances, he can go to Family Court and ask to vary the maintenance order downwards. The first reason is his financial situation. The second reason is his re-marriage, he has an additional responsibility to his current wife."
"Divorced with his wife. Whether he needs to pay his wife maintenance ($1000) if his son is 21 years old ($750 each month till 21 for each child), based on the order of court. Mediator at the family court asked him to seek legal advice.

He is not sure when he can continue to get the money to pay.",Document phrasing seems open to interpretation.
"Client's wife told him that he has to attend a maintenance summons at the court, otherwise he would be arrested. She had been a homemaker for most of the 28 years long marriage and proposed to get half of his salary. ","Now, he can go to the Family Justice Court to get the documents which his wife has submitted. 

He has to attend the hearing and contest the proposal. The judge would consider multiple factors to decide on the reasonability of the proposal. After the hearing, there would be mediation. If it yields no result, the case would go to trial. 

Two main issues are maintenance and division of matrimonial assets. 

He could try to stipulate a time frame for maintenance. "
"Applicant divorced his wife in 2016. Applicant is presently self-employed as a tutor, earning about $1,500 per month. He is presently paying $1,600 a month for child maintenance. His ex-wife is a teacher who earns about $8,000 - $9,000 per month. At the time that he agreed to pay $1,600 a month for child maintenance, he was still employed. It was a consent order and Applicant was represented by a lawyer. Applicant wants to lower the amount to be paid for maintenance of child. ","Applicant advised that a consent order is difficult to vary. Now that there is a change in circumstances, he has to check the consent order and see if there is any room for variation. He needs to take out an affidavit to declare the change in circumstances and which paragraph of the consent order he is seeking to vary. "
Enforcement of Maintenance Order from first marriage. ,"To vary the order, a change of circumstances must be proved. 
- Now that there is a child from the 2nd marriage, the expenses have increased. As well as the wife's salary has gone up.
- Mention that he has been out of job for 11 months and has accumulated debt. 
However, wife can also take out a counter application to say that the children from the 1st marriage also require an increase in maintenance fees. "
"Client was divorced six years ago and wants to vary her child maintenance fees, in light of her rising costs. She has tried to contact the defendant but he was not cooperative. The client also understands that the defendant may be filing for his second divorce and has a second child with his second marriage. The client's child stays her the defendant from Mondays to Thursdays and stays with the client from Fridays to Sundays. The client wants to send her 12-year-old for additional Chinese tuition as he is sitting for his PSLE this year.","Client is advised that in order to increase the child maintenance fees, she will need to convince the judge why the enrichment lessons and tuition are required. Currently, the order is such that the defendant will only pay in full if both parties agree. If she intends to vary more terms of the court order, she should engage a lawyer. If not, she should represent herself if she only intends to increase the amount of maintenance. Client is also advised to find out the financial capability of the defendant. It will be easier to justify the increase in maintenance if the defendant is in a better financial position. The client will need to justify to the court why she should be allowed sole care and control, and offer reasons why it will be more beneficial for the child."
"Court order stated that wife has to pay maintenance for children. Husband stopped sending her daughter to an enrichment class, and wife already paid some money for it. He withdrew the daughter and the deposit was forfeited.","Applicant cannot deduct from the monthly maintenance. Applicant can apply for variation of maintenance due to material change in circumstances. Applicant can apply to the family court again.
Since there will be a hearing after the mediation, she can raise it up also. She still has to return him the $250 she subtracted from maintenance. She can bring receipts for payments to the enrichment centre, and the screenshot of the withdrawal form. Judge will then decide whether she has to pay back the $250.
It will not affect any application to get care and control, which looks at different factors."

- Mediation is only for maintenance, wife has not applied for divorce yet. Usually maintenance is provided until 21 years old, unless they pursue their studies.
- Bring all documents, including CPF statements etc.
- If a mediated agreement is made, registered as court order. 

Wife can still apply for maintenance even if there is no divorce.

If wife applies for divorce, possible for wife to contest ownership of flat: if she had made contributions to the flat (eg interior design, maintenance, non-pecuniary contributions). If no agreement, up to the judge's determination.

If Applicant agrees to divorce, it takes 2 steps:
1) if Applicant agrees, divorce
2) contest for assets, and custody, care and control. Custody (who makes important decisions for children, usually both parents), Care and control (with whom does the child wish to live?

  - assets of both husband and wife will be pooled together, and divided among them.

She was informed that if she wished to file for divorce in Sharia Court, she would have to consult a Sharia lawyer. Furthermore, she would have to total up her costs of living, including the costs of travelling to Singapore to attend the divorce proceedings. Applicant was also advised to produce as much evidence as she had of her husband's ability to support her and their children.

If Applicant wished to file for an extended stay, she would have to apply to ICA, and provide reasons of her need to stay in Singapore, and evidence for the above reasons."
"Applicant is in a situation of being thrown out of the flat by ex-husband, A/P. He gave only maintenance $150 to her every month. Applicant is a Permanent Resident. Both has a matrimonial asset of a HDB flat. If the flat is sold, Applicant will only receive 40%. ","The Applicant does not need to worry about the house as both Applicant and A/P have ownership of the house.  For example, if the husband was to bring an housing agent to sell the house and the housing agent was to propose a price of $200000 for the house, Applicant can voice out her opinion that she actually wants the house to be sold for $300000. Even if the husband was to bring the case to the court, Applicant can make her stand by saying that she actually needs the money as she is not financially stable. 

Applicant and A/P must sell the house without further delay as both have delayed the order for very long. In a best situation, Applicant can actually talk to A/P and decide for a 50/50 share so as to receive a good sum. 

If Applicant wants to increase the maintenance without talking as her husband is not understanding, she can proceed to Legal Aid Bureau for a lawyer. Legal Aid Bureau is a cheap alternative taking into consideration Applicant's financial status. "
"Applicant was unemployed since January, but only summoned his wife for variation of maintenance until now. Applicant is the sole owner of his property, and had consented to everything in the interim judgement. However, Applicant intends to sell his property now. ",Applicant can try to appeal but it would be quite difficult for Applicant to get the variation he wants as he has been unemployed from January but had not reported the change in circumstances officially at the time of agreement. Applicant can try for Legal Aid if he cannot afford a lawyer. 
Her husband commitment adultery. She has 2 children who are very young so she wants her husband to come home. She wants the children to experience a completely family and she is still in love with her husband. ,"There is no law to force the husband to come home. She can't sue the woman as it is not a crime, even if she has photographic evidence. It is best to file for divorce as the husband is not going to go back to the family. She can ask the court to file for maintenance from the husband. "
"Has care and control over two daughters. Father does not want to pay for half of the university fees of eldest daughter, even though already provided for in order of court. He only started paying children's maintenance in July 2016. 10 months' arrears of S$300.00 per month. ",Yes she can ask the court to deduct from his CPF if there is enough funds. He has also agreed as seen in his solicitors' letter. She can lump the amounts in the application for them to be heard together.

"Individual is divorced - re-married and has another child now. He wants to apply for variation of the maintenance amount regarding his previous marriage. He took out his name from his previous matrimonial home without any CPF refund, and with a $1000 maintenance fee. He does not have children from his last marriage. 

His wife verbally said that the $1000 maintenance was to look good but would not enforce it. She however lost her job awhile after - and asked for maintenance fees. He did not agree, and she took out an enforcement. Following which, he paid her for a few months before losing his job. He did not manage to pay her maintenance and she took out another enforcement. He then told her that he will be applying for variation of the maintenance. 

He did not however manage to apply for variation after engaging his own lawyer to try to do so - the application was rejected. The final ruling was that he was to give $1000 per month on top of previous months he did not manage to pay her. ","May not be easy to vary the terms as he is drawing a decent salary - especially since his ex-wife is not working. The only new circumstances would be that he has a new child now that would increase his living expenses - but only marginally for now.

He may be able to vary it more effectively if his living expenses increase (maybe when his child gets older).  "
"Applicant wanted higher maintenance from her ex-husband, from 2k to 5k. ","File a maintenance order at the Family Justice Courts. She should engage a private lawyer if she does not qualify for a lawyer under the Legal Aid Scheme due to her income. For maintenance, it is dependent on her spending per month, where she would need to show her receipts. For division of matrimonial assets, it is dependent on her direct (how much she paid for the house) and indirect contributions (her duties as a wife, doing house chores)."
"Applicant is divorced and is paying maintenance of $300 and 50% of expenses for childcare.

On Sept 2017, his wife wanted to claim $900, but the applicant feels that it is unjustified and wanted to negotiate with her. He questioned why their 9 year old child would require so much money for monthly expenses.

","Advised that if he doesn't pay for this month, the wife may claim receipt of 50% for the past 1 year and go to court saying that he has breached the court order and file an enforcement proceeding. Alternatively, he could challenge if the groceries ($400 per month) and transportation was purely for sole benefit of her child or did she also use it for herself?"
"Enforcement of Maintenance order - education insurance has matured. The court has given a date for enforcement. The Family Justice Court whilst deciding on enforcement of delayed payment of maintenance order, told Applicant that insurance must be claimed elsewhere. She does not have copy of life insurance or education insurance. ","On the day of enforcement, mention to the officers that she would like to include the insurance under the enforcement of maintenance. "
"Applicant has an ongoing maintenance order with his ex-wife who is overseas. It was raised to the judge that there was an overseas order. His child was born overseas and both his ex-wife and child are in overseas. 3 weeks ago, his ex-wife came to Singapore again. It is disrupting his work here. ","Applicant is likely to need a lawyer in Singapore. He is advised to vary the court order and reduce the maintenance in Singapore to the amount in foreign currency converted to SGD. If he cannot get a private lawyer, he can try going to Legal Aid Bureau or PJP. Besides varying the order, his lawyer can also help to rescind the order. However, the dollar is fluctuating so in the long run it might still be quite costly. 

Regarding his ex-wife's negligence in writing the address, he should approach his lawyer. If he sues her for defamation, it would be difficult to get lawyers in Philippines to serve it upon her and it is very difficult to succeed in a defamation suit."
"The Applicant is pregnant. The father of the unborn child does not want to have anything to do with either of them (i.e. Applicant and unborn child). The father is separately a married man. The child will be born next month.

The Applicant bought a car from her previous company in the father's name. She paid in full ($10500) next July. She only has a screenshot of the money transferred to the guy.","The screenshot can still be used as evidence, since the date and amount corresponds directly with the car purchase. The par value will be returned to the guy.

Although she is not married, she has the right to apply for maintenance for the child. He has a responsibility to maintain the child. As to the hospital and child-delivery charges incurred, these may be harder to obtain from the father. The responsibility begins when the child is born.

If the procedure is too overwhelming, she should engage a lawyer."
"Family matter: 3 children, divorced 2005 (married 10 years). 2 Daughters, 1 son. Custody was given to mother for daughters, son to client. Wife moved abroad. But the courts say client can access every fortnight for 1 full day. This takes about 2 years to make the mother return to SIngapore so father can see children.

Since been reduced to 1-3 because they do not know the father. Mother is now further restricted access. The girl is now 20 and 19. Boy is now 17 Years old.

Yesterday client won the cases to cancel the PP orders. 

The mother had care and control custody from 2005 of the daughters. The daughter spoke of dislike of father during the case to cancel PP. ","Because the children are adults, he cannot go to the courts to make them see him.

There is no action regarding the upbringing. 

At 21, if she is still completing her first degree, she can bring the father to court to continue the maintenance. Father does not know if/where she is studying. Wants to stop maintenance because the daughter said she did not like him in court. But there is no recourse. 

As they are above 16, there is no court that will change the care order. "
"Maintenance order of $450 only for 17 year old son going to NS soon. It's $500 but now that Applicant is married $50 was deducted. Now there's financial issues due to the current husband's business troubles and there's a 3 year old son from the current marriage. The 3 yo son has speech delay impediment therefore Applicant has deferred working to take care of the child.
The previous husband is currently working as an engineer and he's currently married with no children.","All these factors must be placed in the affidavit to explain to the court why the maintenance ought to be raised. Crucially is related to the financial position between the ex-wife and ex-husband. Factors to be considered are child's age of majority, cause of financial difficulties, relative financial positions etc. Place in ITE education vs previous nursery education to highlight that the current maintenance of $450 is insufficient.

Advise to get a lawyer as the factors put in are crucial and relevant. It must not seem like it's a family problem and not the son's expenses. 


Procedural matter: Get additional ""monthly expenses form"" to fill up. Get medical proof for the 3 yo son's condition. "
"Applicant had gone through a divorce more than 10 years ago. Applicant disagreed to a reduction in maintenance as proposed by her ex-spouse. Ex-spouse has not paid maintenance for 5 months. Each time Applicant makes reinforcements, her ex-spouse refuses to pay. Applicant's ex-spouse recently had self-declared bankruptcy. Ex-spouse claims that his brother had engaged a lawyer on his behalf. Ex-spouse puts his income under his brother's name.",Applicant needs to obtain the name of her ex-spouse's lawyer and that of the judge as well so that she can write directly to the lawyer and clarify on the issue of bankruptcy. The law requires ex-spouse to show a significant material change of circumstances to allow the reduction in maintenance. The ex-spouse will have to file an affidavit if the Applicant disagrees to what he alleges. Applicant will then need to explain her own reasons why she disagrees with the reduction in maintenance together with the past arrears she intends to claim. Applicant cannot compare her case to that of her friend as it goes by a case-by-case basis. Applicant can make a table to show the past delays in making payment to the judge.

Applicant was married to him for 4 years, and did not have children with him. Unreasonable behavior was the ground for divorce. Applicant's currently works as a waitress and cashier at a pub, her salary is about $1,700. Applicant wants to save the marriage, but husband does not agree.","Applicant does have the right to claim the maintenance fees even after the divorce. However, it is quite unlikely that she can be given the fees as she does have a stable job.

Documents involving the divorce need to be served to the applicant, after which she needs to engage a private lawyer or go to the Legal Aid Bureau to engage a government lawyer. Even if applicant doesn't sign the documents, the divorce can still be carried through with as an uncontested matter. 

Annulment cannot be raised in this case as their marriage had been consummated already. Applicant cannot go to court and lie. "

If no nomination has been made, the money would go to the estate, upon which the sum can be claimed from the estate."
"Applicant was given first option to purchase the matrimonial home. From 2016-2017, her total maintenance was $1000. She just applied for maintenance variation for her child. The judge dismissed the appeal as her salary has also increased so she will be able to cover it. However she disagrees as she believes the expenditures for the child should be split 50/50. She has hired a maid to help take care of the child while she is busy at work and this makes up a majority of the cost.  ","The court will only vary an order if there is a change in circumstances. The judge feels that the applicant can handle the costs. 
If the judge has dismissed her appeal, she has to make an appeal to the High Court. 
Change of circumstances has to be very carefully explained to the court. Try to put the focus on the child's well-being rather than on the money struggle. 
The lawyer does not recommend an appeal as it is still very fresh in the court.

"A has been divorced for 4 years. During the divorce, A and his ex-wife agreed on a sum of maintenance ($5000). However, the court order given states a sum of maintenance that is lower than what A and his ex-wife privately agreed on. For the past 4 years, A has been paying the sum of maintenance that A privately agreed on with his ex-wife.","There will be practical and emotional problems regarding his ex-wife, but legally A will have no problems. Since the court order has stipulated that the sum of maintenance is as such, A is entitled to pay this amount instead of the higher amount that he and his ex-wife privately agreed on.

His ex-wife might limit his access to his child (she has custody)."
"A is concerned with the provision of maintenance for his children, one boy of 10 years old. Order has been made for a maintenance of $900 for the child. A is of the view that this amount is excessive and wishes to appeal or vary the order. A has changed his job recently, but kept this information from his lawyer and the court. The salary of the new job is substantially lower as compared to his previous job ($3,500 as compared to $2,000).","Unlikely for an appeal to succeed (it is also more expensive as compared to a variation). A would have to show error in calculation or that the judge has placed undue weight on certain facts. This is unlikely to work since it is A's fault he kept the information (that he has changed job) from the court.

In order to vary the order, A would have to prove ""material change of circumstances"". A needs to inform his lawyer as to his change of job. It is possible for A's lawyer to make further arguments before the judgement is extracted, but time will be tight. If not, A will have to wait for the judgement to be extracted (which may take several months) before making an application for variation. "
"Applicant is father to twin boys. The mother to the children (who is not the Applicant's wife), is filing for maintenance for the children. Applicant said he gave her the $40,000. Mother is also not allowing Applicant to visit the children.","Applicant could propose the $40,000 to be part of a lump sum payment for maintenance ordered. Applicant would need to adduce evidence of the $40,000 sum as being given from the Applicant to the mother.

"A/P has a mediation session with her ex-husband later this afternoon. A/P's ex-husband stopped paying alimony for the past 4 months. What A/P would like to understand is what if he can't pay or claims that he cannot pay? A/P has 15 year old child with him, and there's no maintenance for her. 

A/P should inform mediator that she wants him to pay this amount. There's arrears now, so she should make that known.

","Main issue here is money. Go through the mediation and let the court know that he is necessary to pay (there're arrears etc.) Fact that her current husband can maintain her might be important. She needs to show why she still needs to receive maintenance from her husband.

If the ex-husband wants to get custody, he would have to apply. Court would have to balance what's best for the child, and will also take into consideration what the child prefers.

A/P may approach the legal aid bureau if need be. "
"Undischarged bankrupt. Court started discharge process 2 years ago. Final stages right now. Here to talk about alimony which court has put at $1,500. 63 years old - undischarged bankrupt but he has to pay alimony. 

Payment for bankrupt sum - about $550,000. Used to pay $300/month, now paying $50/month. Green scheme (within 14 days can apply for travel). 

Issue here is maintenance. He's a copy volunteer and when judgment came, for alimony - he can't volunteer anymore, has to seek employment. The organisation continues to pay applicant 18,000 per annum for the volunteer work for the last 8/9 years. Both applicant and his ex-wife are non-Singaporeans.

Although daughter is working and financially stable, she is apparently not supporting ex-wife. context is just ex wife staying with daughter. 

Issue is maintenance - cannot afford to pay for it. Now the organisation is giving him money to pay for alimony. Ex-wife and daughter - not sure if they have knowledge about where he's getting alimony from but he doesn't think they know. 

","Try to reduce alimony to $500. Show proof that $1,500 at that point in time was possible, but now it isn't. Show it all in the affidavit. It will be tough but try. 

Alternatively, propose lump sum payment to the ex-wife. 

In lawyer's view, make A/P's position known. It is already difficult since the alimony payment was already varied once. But, what the A/P can do is to state his position in the affidavit. 

The position is that A/P has current wife and young children - A/P's wife makes a lot but her previous income tax sees a deduction of $1.5 million, because her client owes others money. All these state clearly and it will help the case.

Next step: see a lawyer. 

A/P cannot afford lawyer and went to Legal Aid but Legal Aid referred A/P here. He failed the means testing - they did not understand why his wife had income tax deduction of $1.5 million. Although his wife makes $10,000 a month, everything is tight due to the tax deduction.

It was a contested divorce to begin with. There were many issues - but now the focus should be on issue of maintenance. Review what points were contested on the issue of maintenance. "
"Arrears in Maintenance issue.

Previously he has already approached Legal Aid, but applicant says that they have taken a long time without writing the affidavit. 

If he doesn't pay and serve sentence, he still has to pay the amount. 

Either hire lawyer/PJP. Legal Aid has rejected him for the previous issue (on arrears), although they did assist in the second issue on the current maintenance. Can tell Legal Aid lawyer to change the court order, saying that he has been paying the amount directly. Emphasize that its for changing the court order, not on an issue of arrears. "

#NAME?,#NAME?
Applicant's husband threatened her with not paying maintenance and would apply to have her permanent residency revoked. She has a child from her first marriage and no children with the current husband.,"Lawyer advised the Applicant that since the Applicant had always been independent of her husband in terms of finances, there is a chance that the Court might not grant maintenance. Thus, the Court may order ""normal maintenance"" which may be nominal. Nominal maintenance is technically different from no maintenance hence the Applicant should be aware of the difference. 

On the issue of PR, the husband cannot apply for a revocation. Once the authorities have given a person the status of PR, it cannot be revoked based on such circumstances. 

Although the home is under the Applicant husband's and his mother's name, the Court recognizes indirect contribution by the spouse, not necessarily financial contributions only. At this point of time, it would be difficult for Applicant to insist that the husband pays for her expenses on renting outside of the home (should she decide to accede to her husband's threat to chase her out of the home). Also, the Applicant does not own the home and thus has no legal right to insist on staying in her home.   

Lawyer advised that the Applicant engage a lawyer for the divorce proceedings. Only after the divorce has been granted that Applicant can proceed on maintenance claims. "
The client's ex-wife has applied to vary a court order. The client wants to counterpropose new terms.,"If the client does not want to engage a lawyer, he has to prepare his affidavit himself. The client may apply to court requesting an extension to prepare his reply. He has to state his reasons for disagreeing with the application.

The client is advised to engage a lawyer, as responding to his ex-wife's application requires professional preparation of documents. He has to inform his lawyer about the history of the divorce as this may be drafted into his counterproposal. Further, his wife had consented to the previous order and was in fact the one who had proposed it.

If the client does not dispute his ex-wife's application, the court will grant her order."
"Applicant is here regarding maintenance issues ($700/month). Respondent is unreachable and untraceable, family court said that applicant cannot issue a warrant of arrest as she does not know his address. Respondent's family is also not in contact with the respondent. Previously, respondent promised that he would transfer all the money.

Applicant is working as auxiliary police and has two children. Respondent was previously in prison for several years, and applicant did not receive maintenance during this time.","Lodge a police report, and later a magistrate's complaint. Need to use the right words, say that the respondent threatened and scolded applicant. The police report must show evidence of the vulgar language used. This is to get the magistrate to tell the police to trace him. 

Applicant can also say that respondent has moved out from the address stated on his IC but has not changed the IC address. (however, this might derail applicant from the issue which is to find the respondent)"
"Ex-husband has passed away in June, 10 months of maintenance in arrears owed, $2700. Divorce was made final in 2008.","1. Apply to court to amend the order, such that it is paid out of his estate instead.

3. advised to approach PJP."
"The client has been sued by his wife for maintenance. The client has been married for less than 3 years. There has been maintenance order for $1,700 for the son and his wife. The client has not paid the maintenance and his wife is now enforcing the order. The client is due to attend a hearing on 25 August 2017.","Since the client has been married for less than 3 years, he can only divorce if his claim falls under established categories e.g. separated for already 3 years, unreasonable behavior, adultery. Adultery is likely to be inferred from the circumstances. If the client wants to sue his wife for adultery, he has to collect evidence such as by engaging a private investigator and he has to prove that his wife was being intimate with someone else.

The client is advised to sue under unreasonable behavior instead as it has a lower burden of proof. He can show that his wife has been unreasonable in kicking him out of the house.

The client had agreed to the maintenance order. If the client now wants to vary the maintenance order, he has to show that his position (or his wife's position) had changed materially since the court order was made. The claim for adultery is separate from the maintenance order. Hence, even if the client succeeds in his claim for adultery and divorces his wife, he might still have to comply with the maintenance order. However, the divorce outcome will supersede the maintenance order. The client was advised to engage a lawyer."
Applicant has divorce proceedings finalised overseas. She is looking for legal recourse to enforce the maintenance order by given by the Singapore Courts. She has been attending court as a Litigant in Person after running out of funds.,"Volunteer lawyer advises applicant to enforce the order of maintenance.

"Applicant is currently divorced and she shares custody with her husband, but is in full care and control of her son. She has a PPO against her husband. The Shariah court order has no exact date to pay the maintenance by, but he never pays on an exact date and sometimes gives her in instalments. Her husband continues to harass her, and threatens to pay her half of her current maintenance if she continues to hold the PPO, as he wants to apply for Singapore citizenship. 

He still verbally abuses her and never pays the maintenance on time, despite the current PPO existing. ","Apply to the family court and ask them to clarify the order and place an exact date on when he has to pay the maintenance money by. 

Could also seek legal aid, due to the financial issues present.

- Applicant believes that his ex-wife is still working, and hence, she will also have to provide support to the son.

"Applicant has provided monthly maintenance fee for his children beyond his intended need to. All three of his children are above 21 years old and has working capabilities. The maintenance order states he needs to provide the maintenance fee of $1000 on a monthly basis into the bank account, he has provided maintenance fee for only a year and stopped in doing so.

Refer to AHPBS:
-Applicant has provided monthly maintenance for his children beyond his intended need to.
-Claimant is also aware that this is beyond Applicant's obligation to continue providing maintenance for his children.

Hence the lawyer feels he should be referred for legal aid (AHPBS)."
"Applicant must make the monthly maintenance of $900 to his ex spouse and his children. He is unable to provide the maintenance regularly. His monthly salary is $2,580 but he was unable to make payments due to various reasons such as medical fees.

Applicant to make enquiries with ICA on the requirements for sponsorship of a student pass, the time required to apply for a PR for her son and the application of PR.  

Key is to engage a family lawyer soonest so that the lawyer can look into the above aspects, especially since some of the aspects such as the PR and student pass status are time sensitive.  "
"App was supposed to enter a second round of mediation. (it involves the payment of maintenance to his ex-wife). However, he has since lost his job but his ex-wife does not agree as to how much he should pay (given the fact that he has lost his job). 

App's ex-wife's maintenance decreased last year to $1,500 but this was not pursuant to a court order. Now however, she demands that the amount be back at $2,500 (this is the amount pursuant to the court order)

"Client (defendant) wishes to increase children's maintainance. 
Client's husband has sold the matrimonial asset. 
Variation order of court dated 26 October 2016
Client was represented by legal aid bureau","Client to do a summons followed by an affidavit. 
Client and ex-husband has joint responsibility to take care of children, client has no right to impose burden on ex-husband to buy a life saving policy for children. 
Client has to get her own lawyer who is more familiar with the material facts of the case, and to look into the insurance policies to see if she has grounds for claim.
Client has to have a standing to look into the insurance policies. "
"Applicant gets maintenance from her ex-husband. He was supposed to give $900 for the four kids. It would be around $1,200 including miscellaneous. ","Does the husband have money to pay the wife?

If the applicant's husband did not comply to court order, it would be contempt of court and there would be an arrest warrant for him. However, the applicant  would not get maintenance.
Judge has made an order to pay every first day of the month. Applicant would have to inform the court that the husband has not been paying. She should probably should ask for lump sum and not monthly payment.
Thus, she should calculate the reasonable amount (in lump sum) for the children and go to court. "
"Client is undergoing divorce proceedings. Her husband plans to move out of his house as of a date and consider it the start of separation. They have been discussion for divorce since 1 year ago which she has documented evidence in WhatsApp conversations. She claims that he has since changed his mind. 

Her husband slapped her daughter and she made a police report. She is also considering a PPO against her husband. However she is not working and hence has financial issues. She is also a PR and her husband has threatened not to renew her PR status when it expires in April 2019. He has also threatened not to pay the maid.
","There are a few issues
1. Interim issues - Maintenance

She may go to family court to obtain maintenance from her husband even in the interim process of filing for divorce. She needs to bring her marriage cert and birth cert. She also needs to come up with a list of expenditure. Suggest for her to do this before getting a lawyer.

The court will issue summons to her husband. There will usually be two rounds of mediation. In the first round, the client will state her requested maintenance amount. Then there will be another round of mediation. If it cannot be settled then they will have to take dates for trial. At this point she may then decide whether to engage a lawyer. 

There is no point to engage a lawyer at this point anyway as lawyers are not permitted to go into mediation.

Husband is a high wage earner and gives wife about $6000 for expenses to date. However he is threatening to cut off this amount. She is concerned that husband would not pay for daughter's braces which he previously agreed for. 

Lawyer suggests to itemize the braces item in her maintenance package, and not to begin on treatment before she receives the money since it is not particularly urgent.

With regard to the ""reasonable lifestyle"" benchmark, daughter's ballet and piano lessons may or may not be considered her reasonable lifestyle. Hence if the court decides that they are not reasonable she may not be refunded for these items retrospectively. It is hence up to the client whether she wants daughter to continue these lessons with external funding with possibility of no refund.

2. PPO

She needs to go and apply for this.

3. Custody, Care and Control
Children are 8 and 13 years old. Client will likely get custody, care and control given their age and the fact that she is the mother.

She is concerned that her husband may have exhibited signs of violence and molest to her daughter. He has slapped one of the daughters on one occasion for which she filed a police report. She also noted that her husband stroked her daughter's back but is unsure if this would consider sexual harassment. Lawyer has advised that this is entirely up to client as it is subjective.

Lawyer agrees with client that these incidences may be taken adversely against her husband in the anciliary proceedings with regard to children. Custodial issues include schooling issues, medical issues, change of name, religion etc.

Access of husband to children includes travel plans. If client gets a PPO then it would help prevent her husband to take the children out of the country.

4. Inter-territorial jurisdiction issues
Client's husband is a foreigner. It is possible that even if she commences proceedings in Singapore, her husband may commence proceedings oveseas. It is hard to predict the outcome as there are technical issues.

5. Matrimonial assets
Jewellery are considered matrimonial assets unless she is able to prove that they are gifts.
If husband takes them away she can lodge a police report.
Even if her husband takes away the title deed to their house, it does not materially change ownership as she is a joint owner of their property.

6. When to commence proceedings
Client and husband have been married over 20 years. Client is thinking of withholding divorce proceedings at this point as her children are still young. Lawyer advises that this is entirely up to him. Client is concerned that she has to continue to ""beg"" her husband for expenditure. Lawyer advises this is a personal decision that she has to make herself.

7. Engaging a lawyer
Client may get a lawyer recommendation by going to the law society.
"
"The applicant's husband is having an affair with other ladies. the applicant has a daughter who has severe epilepsy, and has been terminated thrice because she has to take care of her daughter. the applicant takes baking orders to be self-reliant. 

The applicant does not wish to divorce her husband, but would like maintenance from her husband. she applied to the Syariah court and the family court for maintenance in January. the court ordered that he is to pay $600 every month. but he has not been doing so for the last 6 months. the applicant brought this matter to court, but her husband disputes the sum owed (approx. $3k) and claims that the sum owed is only about $300. the applicant has a hearing soon for this matter. the applicant does not have a lawyer, and she is unsure how to proceed. 

The applicant is also considering to get a divorce with her husband. ","The applicant does not have to do anything because her husband is the one who has to pay, and hence he is the one who has to prove that he has paid her. "
"The Applicant's husband wishes to file for a divorce. Previously, the Applicant's husband agreed to give her $40,000, but now amended the amount to $12,000.","The court is likely to award the custody of the child to the Applicant's husband as the Applicant is a foreigner. In order to gain a higher chance of winning the child's custody, the Applicant must show that she has the intention to continue residing in Singapore with her child, as her child is a Singaporean. 

With regard to the sum of money offered to the Applicant, the Applicant may choose to not accept the offer and leave it to the court to decide. The Applicant may also request for maintenance fees."
"With regard to submission of information for enforcement of maintenance fees, the Applicant is unwilling to submit her income status to the court as she finds it a confidential matter she wishes not to disclose.","The Applicant will have to send in copies of her income statement as her financial status will be taken into account for determination of the maintenance fees. The court will require full and frank disclosure.

An adverse inference may be drawn against the Applicant if she fails to submit her income status.

"
The applicant seeks to recover maintenance from her ex-husband under a Syariah court divorce. The maintenance payments were withheld as the ex-husband is disputing the quantum of the maintenance and has filed an appeal in court. ,"The old maintenance order from the Syariah court is still in effect as long as the appeal has not been decided yet. Thus, the applicant should apply to the Syariah court to enforce the existing maintenance order unless the applicant's lawyer has filed for a stay of execution. "
"Applicant's husband is a foreigner, but husband has converted to Singapore citizen. Applicant involved in a divorce situation with husband. She went overseas to consult a lawyer there: law on separation is different from Singapore's. The lawyer said that the house overseas is solely in her husband's name. Applicant has a condo (which she just sold) in Singapore. Applicant married overseas but marriage is registered in Singapore.","In Singapore, applicant can engage a lawyer (apply to legal aid). Under Women's Charter, she can get maintenance by making an application at Family Court.

Applicant is advised to seek legal advice at legal aid."
"Client is not a Singapore national.  She is currently undergoing a maintenance case in family court. on June 11th she went for mention at Family Court for self defence. The hearing is 12th Sept 2017. Client told the judge that the husband did not provide her anything and he did not get her a long term pass.  The judge made an order that her husband should get her a long term pass till the hearing is over and she should attend court hearing as well. Her social pass is expiring tomorrow. She has WhatsApp-ed her husband if he extended her pass but he did not reply. Her pass is tomorrow and she may have to leave.

Client also made a complaint against her husband in family court yesterday.","1. Lawyer told client to take the court documents and bring it to ICA to ask for extension of social visit pass. However ICA told client that they could not accept these documents. 

Client's sponsor is Chinese and was told that she had to book a flight ticket to India only then would she be given an extension. Her flight is for tomorrow. Explained to client to extend her flight again. However client says that ICA office was very strict and they told her not to come back to the ICA with the same reason. They told her that even though her hearing was in September, they could not extend her social visit pass to September. ICA expects her to leave and return for her court hearing. If she leaves Singapore however she may lose her place in the shelter and would have no where when she comes back for her court hearing. 

Lawyer advised client to get a letter from the shelter and together with the court documents, attempt to get an extension from ICA. Even though ICA has told her that they do not wish to see any more documents she has to try. Lawyer advised client that her request is valid and ICA should try and grant her at least a few days extension until she gathers all her documents.

Client is also concerned that since her husband flouted the court orders now, that even in September during the hearing, she might not have confidence to go through with the cross-examination since she believes her husband is not law-abiding. She is unsure as to how to handle her husband. Lawyer advised client to return here before her hearing in September so that the lawyer here can advise how she may be guided during cross-examination."
"Client is divorced and now have a child maintenance issue.

Client wants to reduce child maintenance, as he has lost his job. He wants to vary the maintenance order. Children are 21 and 17 years old. Client had right of access to the two children. He did not pursue the matter, regarding child access rights. Currently paying $400 a month. It is unlikely that he can reduce maintenance by much. ","Client should apply for a variation. He can apply for legal aid, as he is jobless. He should vary the order by going to Legal Aid Bureau, state that he is jobless and look for a pro bono lawyer. Otherwise client should go to PJP, if means testing fails.

"Client is divorced. He pays $250 a month to his ex-wife, a Chinese PR. He is now remarried to a foreigner, and his current wife has a 12 year old child from a previous marriage. The child is now in overseas. His current income is not high enough for him to continue paying the maintenance and hence the client wants to lower the maintenance that he has to pay.

Ex-wife opens a tuition centre, unsure if she is remarried.

Client's current pay is about $2400 and he works as a cleaner.","Client can try to apply for a lowering of the maintenance to be paid because he has his own family to upkeep now.

He can engage a lawyer if he can afford it, the price might not exceed $5000.

The procedure is not too complicated. Just file a summons and an affidavit (tell the judge his situation and everything else that is relevant).

Can try to lower maintenance fees or not pay the fees at all, if the other party is doing well and the client has his own family to support.

Can bring all the documents related to the divorce to the lawyer. The divorce number is important."
"Maintenance fees in a divorce. Not officially filed for divorce yet. When applicant was married, he was living in his wife's house. He was chased out 6 months ago, leaving all his paper qualifications behind. Wife is asking for maintenance fees of $2,700 per month. On 5 July 2017, he met his wife and gave her $1,000, then asked for his paper qualifications. However, she gave him those that are minor and unnecessary.

Applicant has 2 children. His wife has taken this matter to court, where the decision is pending. ","Singapore law provides that during the marriage, applicant's wife is entitled to maintenance from the applicant. The quantum is that of the same standard as she had been used to. With regard to the ongoing court case, applicant should wait for the decision of the court. In the meantime, applicant should continue contributing maintenance to his wife and children so as to not seem unfavourable to the court.

With regard to his paper qualifications, applicant present the court with evidence of communication with his wife about him asking for the documents.

With regard to the postponement of the hearing, applicant should write in to the court and furnish reasons as to why his hearing should be postponed."
Client's wife is filing for maintenance. The court order was for $800. Client and wife are not yet divorced. This amount was offered by the client and ordered for $800 before family court. Client's basic salary is $1900. He also earns commission but this is variable. The maintenance is only for the child (not the wife). Client is unable to pay $800 maintenance fees. Wife has since forced client to leave the house. The owner of their previous matrimonial home is the client's mother-in-law.,"1. Client needs to engage a lawyer to apply for variation of court order.
He went before the judge yesterday and he was told to apply for variation. 
He would have to go on the basis of his low income. He would have to submit a payslip, company letter stating his salary, as well as his bank statements for the past 3 months.
2. Client says that he is only able to pay $300-500. His wife is earning $2000 a month. Lawyer advised client that what he asks for variation may not be granted.
3. Client is unlikely to escape paying maintenance arrears, even if he was asked to move out by his wife since March. 
4. To retrieve his belongings in the matrimonial home he may have to get a lawyer's letter so that he may reenter the matrimonial home.
5. Client wants to know if he may transfer his overseas property to his father's name? Yes. He may do so to protect the asset. 
6. Client may be asked to declare all his assets even across different jurisdictions. Client's view is that he should transfer out his assets to his family members before he is asked for declaration during discovery.
7. Damages are awarded on a compensatory basis and this may include legal costs, number of sick days from work and loss of income, pain and suffering etc. However there is no guarantee and damages awarded depends on the outcome of mediation/court proceedings."
"The applicant has an enforcement court order from family court against his former wife. The court has suspended the maintenance for 8 months. the $1.1k per month he is currently paying is for the arrears. the court gave the applicant 8 months to vary the order. the applicant would like to know how he may extend the 8 months. the previous court order was for him to pay $1.8k every month. however, with his current job he is only earning $1.6k and hence is unable to pay maintenance, which is why the court has agreed to suspend the maintenance for him to apply for a variation of the court order. Since he currently pays $1.1k in arrears payment, he is unable to afford a lawyer to help him apply for a variation of court order.",the applicant will have to apply to court again to extend the 8 months. the lawyer is referring the applicant to law society's pro bono scheme. 
"This concerns variation of child maintenance fee. The Applicant has lost his shipping job and become a taxi driver. The fee has been reduced from 1500 to 750 dollars. The Applicant was given one year after retrenchment to find a job with similar pay. Currently the Applicant is offered a 2000 dollar job. The Applicant wants to know if a variation will be made again, causing him to be made to pay a higher fee should he accept the job.","The judge will make a fair apportionment. Additionally, the Applicant should seek clarification with the judge's clerks on the backdated amount."
"As per court order, Applicant's ex-husband is supposed to pay her $1000 ($850 is for their five-year-old daughter) as maintenance. However, he has not paid since August 2016 and has insisted that he will only pay $200 in total. Her ex-husband has also claimed that his salary is $1200, but she has discovered that some of his take-home pay amount to $2000. ","Since Applicant is working as well, it is unlikely that she will receive maintenance for herself. Furthermore, it was a short marriage of only 3 years. Hence, she may ask for arrears or get him to continue paying $150 to her for a certain period of time.

As for her daughter, $200 is too low a sum and she should get a lawyer to calculate how much her daughter needs each month. Her daughter's child care fees and transport fees amount to $2k.

She should apply for legal aid or engage her own lawyer. She should also apply for a summons from Family Courts."
"The client's husband is paying for the electrical bills, although the court ordered that the client would pay it. They are now afraid that he will claim against them in future for the monies paid for the electrical bills.

However, during mediation, the wife started to enforce the payment of the maintenance from him.

The divorce was finalized in October 2013.

The ex-husband has no lawyer.","The applicant can seek a lawyer to draft a affidavit, as a variation order is permanent (unless a new one is filed). It is hard to succeed. There must be a material change in circumstances for care and control, wife and child maintenance. This is high threshold. The ex-husband's grounds are a new job (paying $400 less) and re-married and the new wife refuses to work.

The applicant should not mention the household income in her affidavit. She should state her personal income. The applicant should also not mention about her ex-husband's case. She should mention that she receives no maintenance on her part and he earns more.

"Applicant had completed a variation order for change of maintenance fee to his daughter and his wife. The divorce was finalised in 2014 on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. It was a challenged order after 4 years of fighting (a contested divorce). They have a 15 year old son in Secondary 3 and a 19 year old daughter. 

He asked to reduce maintenance to his wife to $400. He has been paying monthly maintenance of $800 to his ex wife. 

Mainly he claims that the fee is for his daughter. However, his daughter began working and it is likely that his daughter will be getting a scholarship next year.","There must be a material, or radical change in circumtances. Varying daughter's expenses is a separate issue from varying his ex-wife's expenses. 

He has a stronger case to vary his daughter's fees since she began working, pays for her own expenses, and no longer requires maintenance. 

Instances for successful variation of maintenance fees cases are extreme, for instance, diagnosed with serious illness, lost ability to work, etc.

There are three areas he should address, as follows: 

First, why file for a reduction within two years? The order was given after 4 years of fighting. This action may be viewed unfavourably by the court. Usually it is done 5 years later. 

Second, his own expesnes. What other expenses have increased? Has his work-related risks increased?

Third, more concrete evidence is needed for his wife. For instance, housing loan has been repaid, or was a good job found? In 2014, her pay was 6k and his, 9k. To his knowldege, his wife's job is the same as it was in 2014.  If the wife is also working and her pay is a little lower than her husband's, then the court may not even award nominal damages. He can seek to stop the payment of damages or reduce to nominal damages. 

He took up a $400,000 housing loan because the house was given to her. However, the court is likely to rule as this was his own doing, why should his ex-wife suffer? His agreement to these terms are significant.  The terms were not appealed.

"Applicant wants to claim maintenance arrears from her divorce. There is a court order for her husband (A/P) to pay maintenance arrears of about $77k. The applicant has tried mediation in the past but to no avail.

The A/P, however, now says that he is currently unemployed.","There is a possibility of the A/P working overseas. The applicant can therefore attempt to enforce the order overseas but she would need an order recognising an overseas enforcement order.

If the A/P still refuses to comply with the order, he may face imprisonment for contempt of court.

Additionally, it is noted that the applicant cannot claim the A/P's CPF monies.

Practically, the applicant might need to ask the A/P in court how much he can actually afford to pay and claim whatever she can."
"The issue relates to applicant's ex-wife who is in overseas now. Applicant got married in 1991, and ex-wife left him a mere two months after she gave birth. The applicant has not heard from ex-wife since she left Singapore.

Ex-wife is now claiming maintenance for child of about AUD$19k.

Applicant has with him an enforcement order, but is not aware of an existing court order.","The fact that applicant has with him an enforcement order means that ex-wife must have taken out court order at some point in time. 

It is important for applicant to get the court order to know the basis of the ex-wife's application.

It may be possible that applicant's ex-wife has filed divorce proceedings in overseas and the applicant has no notice of it. 

Applicant should comply with enforcement order by providing the relevant documents, but at the next hearing, the applicant should request that he see the court order to know what he is liable for."

Client has to apply for variation of maintenance. During the hearing, the client has to show supporting documents of the increase in expenses of the child. 

The court will order an increase in maintenance by looking at two things - 1) whether the husband will be able to afford the increase in maintenance 2) whether the child requires the increase in maintenance.

Normally, when children reach secondary school, ex-wives will apply for variation of maintenance as expenses will increase."
"Client's ex-husband failed to pay her maintenance during marriage for 9 months and client got the judge to issue a warrant of arrest in order to enforce the judgment. The judge referred the client to the CJC.

Client wants to file for divorce because the husband found a new girlfriend a year ago, about the time the client gave birth. ","The police will arrest the husband and take to court.

Client can seek help from the legal aid bureau, where she will have to pass the means test and merits test.

unreasonable behavior - always leave home, not good to wife

He have given equal amount portion of most of his assets (CPF, Shares, etc) to his ex-wife. He wish to vary the maintenance amount now to start saving for his future. ","Client should apply for a variation order to vary the maintenance downwards. He should go to FJC to file an application. 

The children are above 21 years old, therefore the maintenance should be stopped. However the maintenance for the wife remains until she remarries or dies. 

The best option is for client to vary the maintenance order. Client can consider engaging a lawyer so that he does not have to get emotionally involved in this matter. 

Client should do up a calculation to show that how much he needs to save up for his retirement. He have to maintain himself as he is getting older and he is still maintaining his parents too. "

The A/P then claimed to have brought the son home and removed him from Applicant's care. However, the son still resides with the Applicant.

"Applicant divorced her husband over 10 years ago and has been claiming maintenance from her ex-husband (Adverse Party).

The maintenance was originally $4300/month and this amount was proposed by the A/P during their divorce proceedings. Applicant agreed and reduced the amount by $300. This maintenance is for the Applicant solely. The Applicant agreed to the reduction because she was working at the time. However, when she was unemployed, she requested to reinstate the amount but he did not agree. She did not pursue it further due to consideration of his needs.

The ex-husband states that he has lost his job but he is still living a luxurious lifestyle. He has asked a lawyer to represent him in this case and he states that he is not going to pay her anything? 

He did not complete his studies too. All the payments are made through cash. ","The client should engage a lawyer to contest in this matter. When the client denies what her ex-husband has mentioned, he will be required to prove it to her. 

Client earns $20,000. This may be a  disadvantage for her and the court may take this into account. The order is in the client's favor and the burden is with him. 

The client should not have stated her loan to him specifically instead of asking for a alimony. She does not have any evidence to say that her ex-husband did not pay her for the past 10 years. under the law, her alimony can only be enforced for 3 years, "
The client seeks advise on child maintenance. The client will get a divorce at the Shariah Court. The client's husband had a massive stroke and as a result he is not working until today despite recovering. The judge said because he is not working he does not have to pay maintenance. ,"The client wants $350 per child.  She can get lump sum maintenance from the sale of the house. The client is advised to go to legal aid to seek help since her court hearing is over and her claim has been dismissed. However, she is not qualified for legal aid. Hence, she is advised to engage a private lawyer. The lawyer can also find the documents of his accounts which show he has been doing business. It is likely the Inland revenue will keep such records."
"The client is divorced. Her ex-husband owes her maintenance fees for more than 7 years. He owed her $200 every month but he filed to reduce the amount by $50. He was sent to prison for 12 days in 2004 and he was deported to Vietnam recently. 

The client wants to know about variations in court orders. She wants to get the money from his CPF account because there is $11,000 over. She wishes to know whether she can get the money transferred to her. ","Variations are only allowed in exceptional circumstances. It is only by order of the judge or a change in circumstances. She may need to file an appeal.

The judge will consider his financial situation and her finances. There may be a reduction in the outstanding fees or allowed to pay in installments but he will still have to pay. Liberties are given in court orders to give room for the applicants to apply for variation for the order, provided there is cause. The judge has discretion to decide the case. There is no need for a lawyer to be involved. 

She can go to legal aid to get a lawyer if she wants to pursue a court case to apply for variation. It has to be via court order if not the court will not entertain. This is with regards to trying to get the money from her CPF account. If she fails the requirements, she can ask for help from the registry at State Courts. "
"Client was the complainant. Now the other party (her ex-husband) has commenced an action against the client (she is the respondent now in this case). Client has been on a dependant pass now. 

The client's husband has now applied for a variation order and he has requested to suspend all the future maintenance payments and rescind his arrears. 

Client is still deciding if she wants to fight the case or not. ","Whatever the client has mentioned against the husband can be raised as a challenge. He will have to answer this. The lawyer then explained to the client what she is going through (based on her case). 

The CPF statement can be produced as a proof of document in court. However, the client will not be able to ask for a period of 10 years or so as it is not realistic. 

The lawyer also explained to the client about the law on maintenance. 

Chances of the rescission is high due to the duration of the maintenance. To find out whether or not the other party has enough money, the client is advised to take up a discovery process. 

Since the client would like to increase the maintenance in the future, you can apply to the court to get a nominal maintenance (for a dollar for example) and vary the order in the future. 

As of now, the client can only show to the court her expenses as of now and why she is not able to work. "
"Got divorced last year and ex husband has stopped paying her child maintenance. He has moved to overseas with his new wife. Husband still has a flat in Singapore in his sole name. Has not yet come back to see their child. 
","If she wishes to do this herself, go to Crimsonlogic/Lawnet bureau to file documents. 

File a writ of summons for non-payment of maintenance to show that he owes her the sum; then apply for summons for substituted service. If he does not reply or turn up, get default judgment and order for maintenance owed. Apply for a writ of seizure and sale against the flat. 

(Needs substituted service bc problem is that she needs to serve the documents on him but she does not have his address; has his email but does not know how often he checks his email) 

In her claim for maintenance, should indicate that he has moved overseas and might not make subsequent payments. Child is only 6 years old so should claim instalments that he has skipped out on and a lump sum cost - calculate how much he would have to pay for the next 15 years. Should also include her legal costs that he has yet to pay for the divorce proceedings last year. "
"Family matters for maintenance:

Enforcement of maintenance. The client is retired and he has been unable to pay the maintenance for months. This is the second enforcement. 

Client is under bankruptcy. 

The maintenance during the time of divorce (more than 20 years ago) was $1,600. The children are older than 21  but they are still schooling. The client has stopped his payment for maintenance ever since last year (exact month unknown).

The enforcement for the first month was $2,000. The second enforcement is now $600 per month. 

Now the client has also another family - 2 kids. The client has found a work but he has not commenced work then.","Engage a lawyer (from LAB) to take up a variation order for the order of court. The client has to produce documentary evidence to show that he has remarried, he has two kids and he has other expenses that he is liable to pay for his new family. 

It is advisable for client to prepare a statement of his monthly expenses and contribution, together with his bankruptcy application. "
"Facts:
The client says that what was agreed upon in mediation is different from what was set out in the court order.
It was agreed that they have joint care and control but the child will live with him and he was not claiming any maintenance.
She wants to know what would happen if she does not give the maintenance.","First, the client needs to ask legal aid to send her a copy of the consent order (1st Feb) so she has a record of it.

If the client has previously gone to legal aid for help, she can go back to them and tell them that a summons was issued against her for the same case to ask for help. It is unlikely that they will conduct another means test for her since she already has a case open with them. All she has to mention to legal aid is that her understanding of the mediation was that in exchange for letting the child stay with the husband, she will not have to pay a maintenance. However, now there is a court order that she has to pay a maintenance. She should also send them the letter from her previous lawyers sent a letter to the other side's lawyers enquiring why they started a suit for maintenance. 

She is advised to send a separate email to the judge regarding the agreement on 1st February. She was advised to do this by the Family Justice Courts.

The court told her to pay $150 a month. There is a possibility that what is recorded in a consent order is that parties are at liberty to apply for maintenance. 

The client is advised to pay the maintenance as the court has the power to deduct the money from the bank account directly or even send her to prison for contempt of court."
"She wants to get maintenance fees from her husband. They are not divorced. He is supposed to pay her $400 per month via bank transfer, and he has not done so. He keeps postponing the payments. She wants to go back to court and make him pay her the 6 years worth of money that he has so far failed to pay her. The Family Courts told her to come to State Courts. ",She has to go to the Family Courts and ask for the order to be enforced. 
"Maintenance for ex-wife. Has been paying for 30 years. First payment was $175; appealed and reduced the sum to $75. 

Applicant did not bring the original judgment. Has attempted to go to the Family Courts, but was redirected to the High Court instead. Applicant has collected the divorce certificate from the registry.","Unusual that the court has ordered payment for such a long period to an ex-wife. Where maintenance is payable in installments, the court will prescribe the payment period. Wife was about 30-40 years of age at the time of divorce, unlikely that the court prescribed prescribed such a long period.

Applicant should obtain a copy of the judgment from the High court registry. The lawyer cannot advise without seeing the judgment.

The court will not monitor the applicant and inform him when he is to stop paying maintenance.

Applicant can try attending other legal clinics if he is no longer entitled to attend legal clinics organised by the CJC. If he wishes to get a lawyer, he shoud ensure that he has the judgment on hand before doing so."
"The applicant is hoping for a rule under Sharia law. Her husband ran away to overseas

This is a criminal offense as the husband is refusing to change his address though he has run away.","The applicant is advised to engage a private investigator to track her husband down. She is notified that the court will not give an order without the husband's address. 
The applicant is also advised to tell the lawyer about the car of her husband. From there on, the lawyer can do a search to find out who the car belongs to. 

The applicant is advised to send back formal letters to inform governments to tell them that her husband is no longer staying with her. These letters will serve as evidence if the applicant goes to court"
"The applicant is going through a divorce currently and it has been ongoing for 3 years, and has not been resolved. 

The applicant has to pay maintenance and at that time, his income was very high due to his business. However, after sometime, the applicants business failed and he fell into debt. The applicant's current income is only about $3-4K in total. The maintenance is however $2.6K. The ex-wife is now suing the applicant for maintenance amounting to a total of $20K. 

The applicant has tried going under legal aid but his past year income was very high and was denied. The applicant still owes outstanding debts to other creditors of over $300K in addition to the $20K. 

The applicant has a registered joint tenancy with the ex-wife for a HDB, which is currently rented out. The income from the rental is entirely kept by the ex-wife. The applicant feels that it should count towards the maintenance.

The applicant has just attended a hearing at the Family Justice Courts in regards to an issue of maintenance. The hearing was an ancillary hearing in regards to the matrimonial assets.","The applicant is advised to prepare the documentation in regards to his salary and his total income and ask for a variation of maintenance order. The applicant however has to substantiate his circumstances to get the variation. Any documents that highlight the income of the applicant should be appended (i.e. pay-slips, commission receipts, cpf statements etc)

The owed sum is undeniable, but that is a separate issue. The owed debt of $20K may be repaid under another payment scheme, separate from the maintenance. The applicant can also ask for mediation in regards to the negotiations for the repayment of the sums owed in addition to the maintenance.

In regards to the rental, the applicant actually has a right to the rental and can provide evidence that the rental has been solely kept by the e-wife to get his rightful share of the rent. Perhaps the applicant can get a sum of the rental monies. It can be taken into account for the determination of how the debt or maintenance can be paid. 

The applicant can seek a translator from the court if he is not confident of presenting his case in English."
"He has been divorced for 6 years since 2011 with 15 year old son. During the divorce, the court order was for him to give maintenance, but he is going for an operation next month on his leg and will be unable to work or draw income for the next 6 months. He is concerned that he will be unable to fulfil paying maintenance due to this operation due to his lack of income in the next 6 months, and wants a temporary suspension of maintenance. 

He possesses a medical certificate mc from a Hospital for 6 months (Jan-July 2017). A letter from ComCare also states that he is unable to work during this period stated under the medical certificate.","Go the Legal Aid Bureau and seek if they can help out by assigning a lawyer to help him draft the summons and supporting affidavit. Inform the Legal Aid Bureau that he will be unable to work for 6 months and unable to draw income. The lawyer from Legal Aid Bureau will help in the drafting of summons and supporting affidavit to vary the maintenance fees.

If Legal Aid Bureau is unable to help, then a lawyer must be engaged to help."
"The applicant was supposed to receive a lump sum payment of $50K from a divorce. Till date, she has not received the payment.

The ex-husband has sold the matrimonial home and has not gotten the monies. 

The applicant brought in several forms from ccrimsonlogic.","The applicant is advised on the proper documents to be prepared and what to fill in. The applicant has to do the physical filling in of forms herself or get a private lawyer to that extent. 

The applicant is advised to get PJP if legal aid has refused the case if she cannot get her own private lawyer.  

The applicant, even if she gets costs, is unlikely to get the full sum or even any sum for that matter. The applicant is advised not to rely on this judgement for costs."
"Applicant is asking about maintenance with regard to his children, who are currently 16 and 21 years of age (as of January 2017). Applicant is currently paying $226 per month for each child. 

Applicant has already paid for the 16 year old child for the month of January, but not for the 21 year old child (since he is already 21 years old). Applicant contends that he does not have to pay for the child of 21 years old. Additionally, the applicant claims that his younger child has been persistently calling him for additional allowances. The court order did not state whether the applicant is required to continue paying maintenance.","Applicant could apply for a variation of maintenance. Applicant could argue that, with regard to the 21 years old, he should not be paying maintenance since the son is in NS and would have some form of allowance. As regard to the child of 16 years, applicant should adduce evidence of his current expenses and argue that there was a material change in circumstances and that maintenance should be varied.

(Lawyer advised applicant to come again for a second round of consultation because he did not bring the full court order)"
"Applicant is divorced. Applicant wants to vary the order and claim for maintenance as the applicant's daughter wants to stay with the applicant now. Previously, applicant's daughter was given an average of 250 per month.",Applicant should apply for a variation of the order of the court to change the care and control order. Applicant's daughter should file an affidavit by herself as well.
"Applicant received an order of Court from the family court. She is not agreeable to the amount granted as she claimed that it was insufficient. Court granted maintenance of 400 for 1 child. Applicant's child is 1.5 years old and is claiming 1k per month in maintenance.

Applicant's former boyfriend's salary is 5k per month.

On a separate matter, the applicant wants to claims hospitalization fee.","Applicant's demand for 1k might be excessive. As a matter of law, the amount granted is based on a reasonable standard. The applicant can file an appeal. However, since the applicant is claiming for pre-incurred expenses, the sum claimed for might be struck out.

The lawyer is of the opinion that the sum granted is reasonable and it might not be advisable to appeal the amount. However, as the child matures, she can raise the amount by a variation order.

As for hospitalization fee, the judge is unlikely to allow a claim retrospectively."
"Applicant wishes to apply for maintenance for her two children on her own without legal assistance. Applicant is currently undergoing divorce proceedings with her husband. Applicant is currently provided with interim maintenance, a monthly sum of $1000 for both her children. 

In their previous agreement, there was no agreement to sell their house. However, the applicant's husband is now contending that the house should be sold, which the applicant disagrees with. Additionally the applicant has a PPO against the husband.","A template should have been provided by the court. The applicant is required to list her own expenses, as well as that of her children. Since applicant has a counsel for divorce proceeding, the applicant is advised to show the relevant documents to the counsel for ensure that there are no issues with the list of expenses. Documents should reflect the applicant and her children's expenses. The PPO could be attached as well."

"Judgment order - maintenance amount for children (Applicant divorced) Enforcement order (for outstanding maintenance) in place currently.

Problem with paying maintenance: change of employment status - earning less than before, drop in salary, result of termination of employment (twice) - he was left unemployed for 9 months in total. Because of this, he has debts, bank loans as a result of trying to pay maintenance - unable to fork out original amount.

There will be a hearing coming soon.","Must apply for variation of Maintenance Order. Previous time he did not succeed, but must try again. Must show concrete proof. 
There must be a material change in circumstances, to be balanced with the level of inconvenience to the other party.

Unlikely that judge will approve variation of order to $800, not to mention that wife will definitely object. Would be better to ask for a less drastic amount. Amount that he is requesting is too low.

VARIATION REQUIRES MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES","Just because he has withdrawn does not mean that he has money ( has to be proven)

Appeal must have failed because the original agreement was entered into by consent.

The initial health condition cannot be used as a reason for variation as it was persisting at the instance of the first maintenance order.
Demotion and reduction in pay can be used as grounds for variation; however, it might not be certain as the salary was reduced by a minimal amount.
Eye condition cannot be used as a grounds if it does not materialistically affect the earning capacity of the applicant.

The decreased in salary in 2016 also did not result in any material change in circumstances to justify the variation.

Pending case of unpaid maintenance. Pay in arrears.

His ex-wife has issued claim for maintanence.


The client does not wish to continue paying. He claims he has no employment, and has already expended monies from his CPF.","The client was advised to explain :

(1) An explanation for why he has not paid monies thus far in contravention of the family court? 

(2) An argument demonstrative why the court should vary the order relating to ancillary matters.

"Family matter. Maintenance. 

Application being filed. Summons have been filed. 

One children, ex-partner. She is asking for $1000 a month in maintenance. 

He gave for 8 months, stopped giving. Child is 4 years old.

Partner is a foreigner.","There will usually be a mediation to resolve the matter.

Go and apply for a copy of the complaint as it is something she has to refer to. At family court. 

See if he's amenable to it, then get a consent order. 

Claim arrears during maintenance. 

Can rely on the consent order for enforcement if he slacks. 

2 rounds of affidavits if it goes to trial.

Try to get it in a lump sum, as a trust. Difficult to enforce as long as he leaves jurisdiction. 

Tracing is difficult.

Liaise with courts for the issuing of summons. Attendance in court must be secured.

Court will have a problem serving an issue. 

Ask the courts to hold until he is back in jurisdiction. But court does not have unlimited patience. 

Ask the judge if he can adjourn the matter.

Write to court for substituted service, in the newspaper, sticking in the front of the door etc."
"Breach of the court maintenance order because even though she is given care and custody, but the husband took the child away. She lodged a police report, but they referred her to the family court. But she does not know what his current address is - he is probably staying overseas.","She cannot approach ICA for the information, because it is official secrets. But she can try to engage a lawyer to see if an exception can be made. Or can also ask the MP to write to ICA.

Procedurally, if she does not have the address, cannot serve notice on him."
"2 issues: 

20 years ago, her husband had a girlfriend and had a son before breaking up, and he communicated with her for maintenance of the son. Recently she has been using more aggressive means to communicate to her husband, which is more vulgar. 
In some of the texts used to communicate she had threatened her husband to 'visit' his family.

Other than money, she seems to be asking for more than maintenance from the husband.

They have asked her to stop 3 times, through a lawyer and a court hearing.


Second issue: 
Child maintenance for the son. There was a child maintenance hearing earlier this year - and the judge agreed with the mother that the expenses for the son does not subtract from the allowance. 

there was a reduction of maintenance after the son entered into the army. 

But a lot of the claims that the mother say she spends on him is not true, and a lot of the figures were off.","Doesn't seem that it is harassment, since she is just asking for money. 
There doesn't seem to have enough for harassment. 
If the husband is feeling distressed, then he may have a claim. 

Most of the vulgar words are not really sufficient to amount to harassment, and the other insulting remarks seem to be from too long ago - not enough for harassment. 

If there is sufficient harassment, she can apply under Protection from Harassment Act, which is similar to a Magistrate's complaint.

If there is a basis the judge will call for a hearing, if not there is no claim.


She can report that the mother is not stating the correct figures of her expenses on the documents. 
The husband has to pay for part of the upkeep of the child, but she should have factored in other things like holiday expenditure and other things. 
They can ask for the amount to be varied. 
After calculating the amount, they estimate that the total of expenses that she spends on the son is only 300 when she claims it is 1000. 

On principle the husband needs to pay for the son until he finishes university. But if her numbers are weird or wrong, then they need to make an application immediately, so that the future sums for maintenance would be varied. 

Since the son has been discredited by the mother - they should file affidavit with the son's statements. The son would have to be in the court in case the mother wants to cross-examine."
"Her divorced husband owes her money in maintenance. 

He is not able to pay for the maintenance.","She should go for a lawyer to get the entire fees from him, including the legal fees. 

Question is whether he has money to pay in the first place - if he has no money to pay then it is unlikely that she can get money from him. 

She should get a judgment in her favour, to enforce payment from him. 
She does this by filing a writ of summons (can download from website) at Crimsonlogic. 

Alternatively she can get a lawyer to help her to do this.

She can try to get Small Claims Tribunal to settle this case for her also, since this is a breach of agreement."
"She is representing herself for a divorce as a defendant. 

The case is going on currently, but her husband was admitted to the hospital which delayed the case.

An interim judgment has been given, and she is contesting on ancillary issues - such as the matrimonial property. 
She has 2 sons, one 20 and 29. 

The dispute is only on the maintenance of the 20 year old son and the matrimonial house.

She asked only for a sum of money on a monthly basis for her son, and he requests his CPF contribution and 50k from the house. 
Mediation percentage is 70 - 30 in her favour. She contested for 80 - 20 but the plaintiff does not agree on. 

She cannot attend the case conference on 1 Nov due to her work. 
Yesterday she was unable to attend the case conference as well, and her counsel went on her behalf, and he postponed the date to an unsuitable date without consulting her.","She should write in to the court to ask for a newer date to postpone it, to the Family Court Registrar, and cc to the other party as well. 
In this, she should state the dates that she is not free. 

She has to pay the $64 for the CPF statements since it was applied for by her, not the court. But before she passes the documents to him, she can ask him to pay for it.

She has not requested for the documents formally as well - so she should file a summons for it and an affidavit.

If the plaintiff is not in a position to pay, it is unlikely that she can get maintenance from him instead. 
She can propose that she gets 100% of the flat, so she waives her right to maintenance."
"The Applicant has been divorced for approximately 19 years. He has subsequently remarried. 

The Applicant has always paid his maintenance over the past few years. However, due to a loss of job, he defaulted in the payment of his maintenance. Recently, there has been an order of maintenance against the Applicant for the children from his previous marriage, due to his non-payment of maintenance. A hearing has been scheduled.

The Applicant has always taken good care of the children, bringing them overseas for holidays.","1) Applicant should write out his explanation, with an emphasis on the fact that one of the child is already working, and that he has always paid up his maintenance. 
2) It is likely that he is not legally bound to provide maintenance for his ex-daughter. However, such is up to the discretion of the judge in the hearing."
"Complained to family court about husband's maintenance. 

Mediation scheduled. Previous mediation, asked for allowance since it got cut because he has a mistress. 

Husband gives $5 everyday. Wants allowance for daughter. Husband is a pensioner. 

Married, still staying together.","Try to negotiate for a lump sum. In Singapore both parents have duty to provide for child. 

Take out application in court if he still refuses to give maintenance due. Ask for amount due to her should include daughter's maintenance also. 

Practical application. Nothing she can do for the moment, but look forward. Real concern of not providing for child. Cite leaving for 17 days and not giving allowance to daughter. 

Ask court to take this into account."
"Applicant was a director of a company. Underwent a divorce 7 years ago, when she was financially sustainable, and hence there was minor alimony awarded by the Court. Under the Court order, the ex-husband was suppose to pay maintenance for the two children, until the age of 21. One of the child, her son, is currently aged 19 and has terminal kidney medical issues. 

Due to health issues, the applicant had to assign her portfolio to others and retire early. She currently works freelance, earning much less as she also has to take care of her father. Hence, she's currently facing financial difficulty to finance her multiple dependents, such as her daughter who's undergoing further education and her son who has medical conditions.","1) The applicant should quickly make a statement as at the current moment the divorced husband has no other family.  The facts would likely support her claim.  
2) She might not satisfy the means test for legal aid. Even if she would, a lawyer would be allocated and she would have no choice over the allocation. 
3) She should sought legal advice as she would require such to make a variation claim for alimony."
"Maintenance Order given 27 September 2016. 
Divorce over November 2015. Applicant lost his business development job in June 2016 owing to him being hauled to court every month with regards to his divorce proceedings. 
He has to pay $760 monthly maintenance for 2 children in arrears.","1. For the past arrears of $3000:

The judge had already decided that the Applicant can reduce payment of his arrears from $3,000 to $500 as a result of his unemployment. This order cannot be altered. 
 
2. For the monthly payment of $760:

Suspension is for a certain number of months until the Applicant gets a job. Knowing that he was going to lose his job, the Applicant should have taken out Suspension/Variation first. Note that the Maintenance Orders only work prospectively and not retrospectively. 

Suspension
Burden of Proof: 
- Show a commitment to finding a new job within the next 3 months. 
- Show his inability to find a new job despite his best efforts.

Variation 
Burden of Proof:
- From the time the order was made till now, the Applicant ought to show a material change in his financial circumstances. He is advised to do so by himself because of his financial difficulties. 
- List of expenses
- Documents of his current income
- The judge has to consider how the children will be able to survive should the arrears be reduced. Therefore, the Applicant can prove that the wife has a higher financial ability to support his claim."
"divorce - got court order. ex husband appealed and got an order. filed app for leave to appeal to CA. rejected.

was informed by lawyer that child maintenance was part of ancillary matters that was dealt with already. during trial process, documents were exchanged and she did not have sight of it.

numbers inflated in the  husband's affidavit - was not informed of it previously because did not see the affidavit.

lawyer's fees too excessive. evading queries on bill.","if the declaration in the affidavit was false, possibly apply to set aside judgment but the threshold is high - may not succeed just based on evidence currently.

2) If intending to look for a lawyer, use the JPJ lawyer's scheme where legal costs is capped at below market rate for 6 hours of legal work. 
3) Prepare all his documents as affidavits and evidence for maximum benefit before seeing a lawyer."
"After divorce, the husband is currently paying her $300 a month as wife maintenance.

He took custody of the 3 kids, and is also doing well financially.

She is currently staying in a rental flat, and is running a business. But on paper she has no assets.","She needs to file a variation of maintenance order through the e-filing system. She needs to explain how much the increase should be and why, which will then be considered by the family court judge. 

She can try to file herself first, if it gets rejected, she can engage a lawyer for the matter. Even if she wins the case, she can only get back a portion of the costs. In certain cases, more costs can be awarded but its rare - for instance if the party files a frivolous lawsuit. 

If she has other matters, she can tag it onto the current matter to have both issues heard at the same time. So she should file her affidavits as soon as possible. She should just file first, and see if the court decides to hear both matters at the same time.

She could use the rental costs, upkeep of her lifestyle and medical bills to substantiate her maintenance claim in light of her lack of income. Not advisable to use the loss of the custody of her kids to argue loneliness. 

His increase in financial standing would not affect the past matrimonial division of assets, but it might help in her claim to increase wife maintenance."
The applicant's wife is seeking maintenance pending divorce proceedings. The applicant has a child and both parents are working. There is an upcoming mediation to determine what is the amount of maintenance to be had.,"The applicant's wife has the right to maintenance, the court will typically expect both parties to share the costs of maintenance for the child.

 Documentation of related monthly expenses such as utilities, medical, food etc. in order to determine what is a fair amount. Documentation of a payslip is also required."
"Adjustment of maintenance - court order from 2002

Applicant remarried in 2006 and has a new family of 2 children, together with a property mortgage. Unable to continue paying the maintenance of $1000.

The younger child is now 13 years' old and studying and his older child wants to apply to polytechnic this coming year. Recently refinanced his mortgage.

Health concerns - liver has a growth since a few years back. Unsure if cancerous or not. 

The ex-wife and the 2 children have grown up and are working now. Total income of around $8000.
    - one working as a pharmacist
    - other working as a tuition teacher
    - wife is still working part time","Applicant needs more recent change in financial circumstances. Age alone is not sufficiently good reason to reduce the maintenance. The ex-wife's children's income though helpful but not conclusive in allowing for reduction of the maintenance.

Prepare medical information that gives evidence of the applicant's health together with more evidence of the second child's polytechnic school fees. State that the ex-wife had also received a sum of money towards her CPF when they sold the flat.

The court is only likely to reduce the maintenance by $250-$500.

Applicant will need to file a summons together with an affidavit. This affidavit to contain the above advised evidence. 

Highlight that the decrease in the applicant's own CPF account would affect his ability to pay for medical treatment that he may need in the future."
"Applicant wants to vary his maintenance - it is currently too high. The current maintenance he is paying is $600 per month. The applicant also needs to support his parents, after CPF his salary is $1,600. His marriage duration was about 6 years.","Whether he can succeed depends on how much he can show - list out expenses eg. not paying taxes, expenses, has to support parents. The fact that his ex-wife has remarried is more of a reason to vary the maintenance. He can justify why he cannot pay the $600."
"Variation of maintenance.

Maintenance for child: $500; Marriage duration: 3 years; Wife has no maintenance.

The applicant claimed that he caught his wife committing adultery. His wife sought a divorce (although he caught her) on grounds of unreasonable behaviour. 

The applicant was previously holding a full time job. He recently changed his job and he is an undischarged bankrupt. He now seeks to vary the order in light of his plight.

Applicant wants to know if the child can choose who the child wishes to be with.","If the applicant wants to stop paying maintenance, he might want to give up all rights to the child.

If the applicant can show that the applicant has been earning little for the past few months and show that he has started a new life (second household) and coupled it with the length of the marriage, he might be able to vary.

The applicant can start an application to gain care and control. It is the child's decision however the court will also be mindful of the applicant's ability to pay for the child."
Applicant is the process of a divorce.  Applicant owns properties and companies under his wife's name. Applicant is currently undergoing mediation for the determination of the maintenance fees.,"Applicant could engage a lawyer to aid in the interim maintenance settlement as it will have a great impact in the subsequent divorce proceedings. Alternatively, he can get a mutual out of court agreement so that the eventual judgment will not take this agreement into account."
"Applicant is already divorced from his wife and as part of the agreement will pay her $600 a month as maintenance. Recently his ex-wife went to family court to file for claim that Applicant had not pay for maintenance. But the wife had taken a loan from his mother. He has evidence to proof that the wife had taken the loan. The loan was reluctantly given to his ex-wife as she claimed she needed the money urgently.

The loan terms was for $32k with a promise to pay back $64k. There was a written agreement on the terms.","The maintenance is meant for their child. The loan is a commercial agreement. The issue is that the maintenance is for the child. The courts will unlikely to recognize that the loan owed by the ex-wife can be used to offset the maintenance.

The change in the wife's financial circumstances may be grounds for a change in custody of the child.

Volunteer lawyer advises Applicant to continue paying for the maintenance as it is meant for the benefit of the child under his ex-wife's custody."

"The client has long been divorced. His 3 children are aged 22, 18 and 10. A variation of maintenance was applied for by his wife some time back. 

The client has been paying a total of $1820 for his wife and children as maintenance pursuant to the court order.  The wife's maintenance currently stands at $400. The remainder go to maintenance towards his daughter and second-eldest son.

The client's income has remained constant since the initial court order as settlement.

He has been paying additional payments for his second son, currently serving his National Service.  He does not wish to keep paying these monies as requested by his wife.","The client is advised to apply for variation and has cogent grounds for doing so given his changed circumstances :

(1) his income has remained stagnant and can be proved to be the same. 

(2) his various expenses have increased exponentially over the years- his eldest son's university education creates substantially higher expenses. 

(3) his second son no longer requires this maintenance during National Service. 



The client was advised as to the two documents required for filing:

(1) A summons, containing the specific and relevant prayers sought by the applicant. The client was advised to specify in detail his issues with the existing court order.

(2) an affidavit in support of his claim, containing facts and evidence furnished to substantiate his summons."

"Woman claiming maintenance against him, he has a child with her.","Under the woman's charter, he would have no choice but to pay maintenance. Mother would come up with a list of expenses and he would have to pay at least half with some discretion according to income.

Not governed under the same maintenance action."
"Applicant is a divorcee. Applicant seeks assistance in the maintenance that he is obliged to give to his ex-wife and child. The wife earns S$1,500 per month. The applicant asserts that the mediator was not willing to hear the applicant's breakdown of maintenance that he should be obliged to provide.","1. There is a duty for the father to give a reasonable maintenance. The issue if whether the maintenance is reasonable. The basis has to be what is the true need of the wife and child. 
The bottom line is what does the wife really need and why? 

2. Child maintenance is different from wife maintenance. The child maintenance means: school fees, food, clothe etc. But the child maintenance is to be provided by both parties.

3. The applicant has been advised to request the wife to provide an itemized list of her monthly expenditure and expenses.  

4. Where the order has been recorded by the mediator and the applicant is not agreeable with it, the applicant has to apply for a variation order."

Check with the LAB if they are willing to make the application from an earlier date. Follow up to ensure that the application is effective as soon as possible to avoid further costs.

"Applicant is applying for interim maintenance enforcement and variation. Applicant doing it herself as she cannot afford the lawyer's fees, which amount to $30k. Has done a chief affidavit and a reply affidavit. Husband submitted variation first, and applicant has to file her enforcement. Quantum is 4300/month, 1440 to the vendors (the children), 2680 to her. There was also a rental and utilities which the husband has defaulted on. Applicant threatened enforcement of the maintenance and the husband complied but defaulted after 3 months, and did not reply to applicant's emails thereafter. Applicant was to increase the quantum to 5000/month while the husband wants to decrease it to 2500/month. Applicant did not argue for a higher quantum earlier as husband was putting pressure on her during proceedings. Husband's reason for the variance is the appellant allegedly moving out of her rental accommodation into the matrimonial home. Husband is an undischarged bankrupt.","Issue 1 and 2: Income disparity does not affect variance as it was considered at that point in time of the maintenance order. Furthermore, both parties consented to the maintenance fee of 4300/month, which raises the bar for variance. Maintenance agreement was also drafted by husband's lawyer

Issue 3: The OA has very little say in this. However, husband's bankruptcy should not affect the variance of the maintenance as the husband has been bankrupt for 20 years.

Issue 4: Cross examination is based on facts, no need to cite legal references.

Issue 5: No, written submissions are given at the end of the trial.

Issue 6: Possible. However, they cannot be taken into account for present legal proceedings.

Issue 7: Applicant recommended to ask for costs. Can get an order for costs on enforcement of maintenance. Re: variance of maintenance, can only asks for costs if it gets varied upwards. If it stays at status quo, no costs. Costs including time spent on the legal proceedings, legal costs etc. (cannot ask for costs on submission of affidavits as it was submitted in court so no legal cost). Applicant also cannot get order for legal costs re: lawyer's fees as she had discharged her lawyer."
"Divorce was about 2-3 years ago. Prior to the divorce being finalised, there has been interim maintenance. Applicant currently has no lawyer and is bankrupt. Ex-wife is asking for enforcement of previous order ($28,000).  The judge is ordering him to pay $500 every month in the meantime. Next court mention is 3rd October. Applicant says he wasn't given a chance to tell the court that he is bankrupt.
 
The applicant is trying to vary the maintenance downwards (this is pending). The applicant's lawyer says that he cannot act for the applicant as he is currently bankrupt and that the lawyer needs to check with OA.

Original settlement was that the ex-wife got the flat, $200,000 of the applicant's CPF and $2,400 a month. His lawyer tried to appeal but during the time period between, the applicant went bankrupt. All the appeal documents have not been filed.","Issue 1: Go on the Family Courts website to get a form to apply for an appeal that the enforcement should be put on hold pending his variation application. If the applicant succeeds in the variation of the maintenance order, he can backdate the order.

Issue 2: Applicant should check the court order about whether the registrar of the family court could sign on ex-wife's behalf. Since the flat is supposed to go to the ex-wife under the settlement order, the ex-wife is entitled to all the moneys obtained from sale of the flat."
"Applicant wants to apply for a reduction of maintenance for his children. Furthermore, the ex-wife is asking him to pay various bills (e.g. phone bill, utility bills etc).

The matrimonial home is still in the names of him and his wife. Applicant had agreed to pay off the term loan and transfer the house to his wife (and thereafter she would pay the mortgage loan). The agreement that she has to pay the mortgage loan is not recorded in the Court Order. He agreed to this because he had arranged to take an investor loan from his company. He can't pay off the term loan anymore because the loan didn't come in. If his ex-wife takes out a summons against him, he may be kicked out of his rented flat.","(1) The only reason the court will allow a reduction in maintenance for children will be a change in financial circumstances, and it should be beyond the applicant's control (e.g. choosing to quit his job or start a new family are not acceptable reasons). 

The applicant should prepare an affividavit that sets out his reasons for applying for the reduction, and provide relevant supporting documents (e.g. medical records, proof of change in employment or income etc). Everything that he wants to tell the court must be set out in the affidavit. 

A reasonable amount of maintenance that he can propose depends on how much he can afford, how much his wife earns, how much his children need for expenses - he needs to work this out himself. One way is to come up with his own list of how much his children needs, and how much of that he can afford to pay. The wife may come up with her own list, and the court will decide which is more reasonable.

Generally since he is paying maintenance, he need not pay for additional bills. 

(2) Since the order of the court requires him to pay off the term loan, he must make a separate application to the court to vary that order for the division of assets. The process is the same, and he can take out the same summons for both applications. He should be clear what he wants from the court, e.g. if he wants a time extension.

(3) He should check whether the Court Order states the full details of their agreement with respect to the division of matrimonial property. If it doesn't, he should clarify this in his application."
"Applicant is divorced. Not represented by a lawyer. Applicant has been verbally harassed by her ex-husband regarding alimony. Currently, the ex-husband is paying $1500/month as maintenance.

Husband is unhappy when he suspects that the applicant is moving on with her life, and threatens to not pay alimony.","Ex-husband has to continue paying maintenance unless the order is changed to vary the sum payable. 
Applicant can submit an enforcement action in Court No. 1 to obtain an order that the ex-husband continues to pay maintenance. 
Should the husband privately requests to pay maintenance in instalments, applicant should deny his request. 
Husband cannot remove anything in the applicant's house since sole ownership has been granted to her.

"Facts: 

Regarding custody matters, care and control of the children. Ex-spouse filed maintenance claim against applicant, claimed that he didn't pay. Applicant stopped the contributions temporarily because of some banking administrative matters (ex-wife did not provide account number for transfer). Arrangement was that applicant would transfer money into the CDAC account (an education account). Applicant was previously the one taking care of the children during the separation, but ex-spouse currently has care and control. Order said applicant would pay to account of one child, the ex-wife to another. Applicant wants to know what can be done now. 


","Advice: 

Legally, applicant cannot say that he is not paying maintenance because he is not getting access to the children. 

If order says that money is not paid, then it is still a breach of order.

Applicant can ask court to request for account number, variation of the court order to pay to a specified account. Account numbers are secret under the Banking Secrecy Act, bank will not reveal it to applicant (since he is not trustee of account).

"Her husband brought her and his daughter back to overseas. He returned to Singapore and informed her that he wants a divorce. She suspects that the H has an affair with his co-worker. He has been uncontactable for a few months. He has not given her any money to take care of their daughter. He contacted her recently to give her some money. 
Their marriage was registered in Singapore. He took a DP for both of them. The child is now 3, and she wants to go to kindergarten in Singapore. She suspects that H now lives with that woman since he took away the coffee machine and the rice cooker. 
He cancelled their DPs after they left for overseas. It is difficult to sue him in overseas as he works and lives in Singapore. 

","Advice: If H lived in Singapore for more than 3 years, can get divorced in Singapore. Since he has, can get divorced here. However, there are problems like housing. He has to pay her maintenance according to Singapore law. The amount depends on her contributions to the family. He did mention that he might want to fight for custody with her. But her friends and family told her that it is only a threat to make her agree to the divorce sooner. Singapore law protects the W, so custody of the daughter will be awarded to her since he abandoned the family. If a Singapore court rules that he needs to pay a monthly maintenance, the overseas courts cannot enforce it. He has the legal right to cancel her DP. W can apply for H to pay a lump sum rather than monthly alimony. If she knows of any property and assets that he has, she can inform the judge, but it has to be Singapore assets. H wants to quickly settle the divorce. Child can go to kindergarten here and he can help apply for DP. However, she has no where to stay has he is no longer renting the house. 

Advice: Find a lawyer to draw up a Separation Agreement regarding, custody and the DP for the child. She has no way to contact him.  She hired a PI to find him, but it was very expensive. 
Right now she can apply for the court to order him to pay her alimony. In overseas, he has no bank account, so since all his money is in Singapore, she should handle the divorce in Singapore. "
